> LOVE, CREATE, EXPERIENCE.

No matter what, ***LOVE*** is the most powerful drive to lift us up, ***CREATE*** is the only way to build a better future, and only when you've ***EXPERIENCE***d enough, you'd be able to appreciate how beautiful the world is, and understand why we should do our best to protect the good, and fight the evil.

## My Rules

My way of respecting people is by:

1. Saying what I really think
2. Trying my best to be most efficient so that I don't waste anyone's time, as well as my own time.
3. Trying my best to help people achieve great things. I really believe that [[the power game is stupid]], we should play more innovation game.

> Adventure is the respectful pursuit of trouble, as well as the disaster that hasn't happened yet.
