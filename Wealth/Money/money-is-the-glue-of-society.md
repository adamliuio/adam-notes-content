title: Money Is The Glue of Society
---

The human world has become so specific. People are customed to choose one thing as their main focus in life and call it career, and we rarely produce anything else outside our career. Then how is it possible that we can have many things in life beside what we produce?

> ***Money.***

Because of the existance of money, we are able to receive money for what we've produced, and use money to purchase what we need & want. While individuals and what we do have become singular, money has become the lines between dots, which turns the human world a giant network *glued by money*.
