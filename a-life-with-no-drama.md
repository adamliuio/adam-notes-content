I've always been curious about how efficient would this world be if there's no *unnecessary drama* happening in people's lives. Fighting, lying, cheating, etc. Of course without them life would be pretty boring, but efficiency is boring, but it's a better type of boring than getting stuck in the traffic jam on your way to work type of boring.

But efficiency frees you up, for you to explore interesting things that would give you new experiences. In my opinion, the fight against *unnecessary drama (efficiency)* is all what life is about. There's no way you can eliminate it 100%, but you definitely can always keep reducing it.

For me, it all started with my hatred towards having to spend time to deal with shitty people: I've had a giant construction site set up right in front of my window without any notice, and filling my apartment with noise & crazy amount of dust **24/7!!!** for more than a year because I didn't have time to move; I hate that I have to lose sleep because my neighbors desire to party all night; I hate that I am forces to deal with office politics because it is effecting me, rather than spending my time working on something useful. This list can go on for a long while, but the main point is that I know I can't change others, while I can always talk shit about what I don't like, what I really need is to not get effected by anything I don't like. This is not being a pussy & escaping from the fight, because escaping from these things require great effort, this is withdrawing myself from the endless unnecessary struggle, and putting myself into a position so that I can work on things that are really going to provide value to others.
