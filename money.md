Money has many faces. It is **Power**. It's **Energy**. And [[Money Is The Glue of Society]].

It's not evil, it's does not discriminate, it's the most just equalizer in the world.

Money is not chased after, it's not made:

> It's attracted.

As contradictory as it may sound, [[The Pursuit Of Money]] is actually a *spiritual journey* (spirituality can be both constructive & destructive). It helps us establishing our *personalities* (good or evil), our *worldview* (big or small, comprehensive or narrow), our *value* (noble or unimpressive). When money feels corrupted, or destructive, it's not money itself that's become negative, but rather, it's how humans reacting to money without understanding it. And when this happens, **a person becomes a slave to money**.

[[Save Money]] is important as well.
