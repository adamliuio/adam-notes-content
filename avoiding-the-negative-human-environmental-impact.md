**I'm scared of climate change**, not only because it will bring significant & unavoidable changes to our lives, but also because the reason we are only starting to take it seriously recently (2021), is because **climate change is not only a climate issue**, but rather a significant part of it is the human politics, human irresponsibility, and the short sighted nature we all have.

That's why I said ***"human & environmental impact"***, at the end of the day, the environment behaves according to the natural laws, we are here to take from it and make it suit our needs. Now, I have no power to help in any aspect in terms of climate change on a big scale as an individual at the moment, while I do want to build my businesses asap and make sure I have enough time and money to help reducing climate change, I also want to make life more secure for my family.

Watching situations like shown in [this video](https://youtu.be/wgtoHYMZV1c) always makes me sad. No matter it's natural disasters or human destructions, generations of memories and histories would be gone without any merci, or ways of avoiding it.

Beside this, wildfires are getting much more often and harder to be put out, [the smokes it creates would really make people's lives miserable](https://youtu.be/-iCuFYf8mdI) without destroying their properties.

I believe we are moving into an age of new ways of housing. Shelter, this ancient & essential idea that most living beings need, is embracing some new ideas in the human world. ***Movement* is part of these important new ideas.** And boats deliver the ultimate movement. Yes, the ocean is like a sensitive thermometer, it would be affected drastically by global warming, but in my opinion, the disastrous events affecting boats would be easier to avoid as a family if compared to disasters (like sudden wildfires & toxic smokes) happening on land affecting people's properties and all the life belongings in these properties, and a car can only take so much luggage & operate on roads that suit, not to even mention the blocked traffic when evacuating.

While a boat is definitely not the perfect solution, but it's definitely better than anything else I can imagine.
