I just came across this [post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CUETlHdFAhv/) on Instagram, it's a animal sacrifice ceremony in Nepal.

This is not unprecedented, this kind of activities have been around for **thousands of years**. What's unprecedented is the calling out for this kind of activities. This is a very weird dynamic.

On one hand, I truly believe that **there's nothing good about animal cruelty**, cruelty wouldn't lift a person's spirits, but rather, it can suck people into dark abysses.

The reason we know this is cruelty is because we can relate, and the reason we can relate to animals because they resemble us humans. Seeing how others are treated would make us feel the same way, and pain has always been the driving force of our fears. The object receiving cruelty doesn't have to be an animal, someone who hurts a realistic humanoid doll can make us feel just as disgusted as what an animal abuser makes us feel.

We humans have been the conductor & receiver of cruelty pretty much for the entirety of our existence. We formed tribes, *conquered, enslaved, killed, raped* each other, simply because we needed to survive, and **survival is cruel**, you either survive or die.

Comparing to the history of human existence, the internet is very young, and relatively small. I personally can't live a life without internet, but as of Jan 2021, [only 4.66% of the global population are active internet users](https://www.statista.com/statistics/617136/digital-population-worldwide/). This is why the internet has created huge differences in different parts of the world, people are more open-minded, productive and diverse in regions with good internet, while the ones live in regions with no internet or slow internet would live more primal lives.

While the internet can help bringing changes much faster and more effectively, things tend to happen much slower when internet is not embedded in people's daily lives, just like the Nepalis shown in the video. While it seems cruel to us, they are simply having fun, enjoying a good time.

**It would be nice to progress, but simply demanding progress and change without putting things into perspective would only show prejudice.**
