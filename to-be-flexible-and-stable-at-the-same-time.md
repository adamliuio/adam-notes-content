As homo sapiens, our need for traveling to & exploring different places have never be different from our ancestors, that's why the travel industry was booming before COVID-19 hit, that's also why "getting away" always sounds so good to most people.

But on the other hand, we also look for stability in life, we are all longing for a place safe from all dangers, a place we can stay at and enjoy life, this is also the reason our ancestors settled down and started growing agriculture, which is a very hard thing to do back then. But if you travel, you can barely bring anything with you; and if you remain stable, you can barely travel and see the world.

A boat can bridge these 2 needs. You can always travel, and always bring your home with you. If you like a place and want to stay there for longer, just anchor there; if you don't, simply move with no hesitation.
