While the modern society has improved our quality of life, we've also sacrificed our sanity. In my opinion, most of the mental issues people experience, including hatred, anxiety, hopelessness, are all caused by the changes to the human society that we call "*advancements*" or "*progress*".

It's simply because these "*advancements*" stripped away most of our physical freedom, as well as our [[Mental Freedom: the freedom to think]].

For instance, megacities are the best representations of human advancements, big money flow through them, big dreams are made within these concrete jungles. I live in Shanghai for almost 2 years, in the 2nd year of staying there, I started to preferring staying at home whenever I could, because I was becoming claustrophobic when I go out and seeing crowds (big crowds are everywhere in Shanghai) before I've ever heard the word "claustrophobic".

And there are many more problems created beside what I've experienced. With the population of modern societies increase exponentially, these problems also worsen accordingly on similar magnitudes.

I left Shanghai and went to Australia before my *claustrophobia* became worse, and since then, least crowded places have been what I prefer the most. **Being able to move our bodies around, being able to see nature and into the distance, has always been essential to us as human beings. It's not a better-to-have, it's a must-have.** Being healthy simply means following the rules of nature and giving our bodies what's necessary, as well as keeping what's harmful away from them.

I escaped claustrophobia before I realized it, and I was lucky. And there are so many people who experience it don't even realize it, not to mention many other issues that people suffer from.
