I just watched the Tony Bourdain documentary: [Roadrunner: A Film About Anthony Bourdain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadrunner:_A_Film_About_Anthony_Bourdain) yesterday. It's great. It's emotional. And it makes you sad.

It made me miss this guy who I didn't even watch any of his shows when he was alive.

Before watching it, I just finished binge watching [Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Bourdain:_Parts_Unknown), his 12 season long travel show, and it is FUCKING GREAT!

# Getting to know Tony through the screen

I've always known about Tony, this famous chef who was making travel documentaries. And I saw the news when he died, I was wondering why so many people were sad about his death, "he's just a famous TV personality, right?" And didn't pay much attention. My opinion of him changed after I watched couple of episodes of Parts Unknown season 1, I was attracted, amazed, blown away.

When pretty much all the travel content you can find easily these days is Youtubers exaggerating to camera how "amazing" a place is and have nothing to say to the camera beside how good is the food and what it tastes like, Tony has set an extremely high bar, that nobody has come above, and in my opinion, nobody will be able to reach that level for a long time.

In 2021, we live in a world of struggle, with all these advanced tech around us, we are spiritually poor. Tony is a saint, in a soulless world; he's also a poet, outrageous, wild, straightforward, yet beautiful. During the time of watching his show, I gradually started to understand the sadness the world experienced upon the death of this "just a famous TV personality".

# Intuition

I've always believed in some kind of intuition, in a way that I can't even describe. I experienced it with my friend Giuseppe when I was in Melbourne, Australia, we hang out a lot, and many times when we got together, he would mention something he was thinking about in the past couple of days, and it was exactly the thing I was pondering on as well. We always talk about a wide range of topics, so when this pattern happens again and again, you feel weird, it makes you think that there's definitely some kind of mysterious links between humans, and there's definitely some kind of mysterious force that's invisible to us and we don't understand but influences the world.

When watching Parts Unknown, the same thing happened.

When watching the episode of Parts Unknown S12E02, Asturias, Spain, without knowing what are the rest of the episodes are about, I suddenly realised this season was made in 2018, and he died in 2018. Sure enough, I googled it, I was right. Went back to the show from my browser, the section was just over, the new section started with his guest Jose Andres smoking a cigar and remembering Tony. It is sad, but the timing of me realising it and seeing it right after I recalled it, was fucking weird.

# Darkness

No matter how famous/rich/respected/knowledgable you're, pretty much all of us are not prepared to deal with what life throws at us. The world is simply evolving too fast, and too much chaos is created in this process. Tony was struggling. Without knowing his past struggles like drug addiction, I was wondering that ***what kind of perspective would seeing the differences between different regions of the world bring him, and how would he deal with the conflict between excessive abundance & extreme poverty, progressiveness & conservativeness, kindness & greed, because without personally traveling to different parts of the world to see & experience for myself, I've already been experiencing the conflict in my head.*** I've always liked listening to different perspectives & opinions, but listening to opposing opinions creates conflicts, and I've been trying to reconcile this conflict of thoughts in my own head for a long time. I've put this perspective in this [trailer video for "The Stories of Us"](https://youtu.be/R2oeadm1mWg).

It's hard to just think about it, it'd be easier for you to treat it like thought experiments & mental exercises without emotions, especially when it comes to the topics about people's wellbeing, survival & lives. But having emotions is a fundamental trait of us, virtuous or evil, emotions drive us.

If the delta COVID variant didn't come, I'd be on my way of making videos around the world now. I'm aware the journey is going to change me in some ways, maybe good, maybe bad, this is out of my control. Will I be able to handle it? It's also out of my control.

Tony was dark, with kindness. But kindness is something you give, darkness is something you fight against. Both of them are taking from you, not giving back. So before you can fight darkness, before you can give, before you can be kind, you need to receive. from all the interviews of people talking about Tony that I've watched, he didn't get much "*help*" from others. This "*help*" is quoted as you can see, because what the hell do they mean by "*help*" anyways? Seeing psychologists? Hang out with friends? If you really think so, you don't understand this kind of struggle.

He was creative, he was extending himself into his shows. But all he relied upon, was all the books & movies he consumed in his younger age. I believe he stopped absorbing the kind of content that shaped his mind and personality when he started making his shows, and while these content opened up his mind when he was young, didn't really prepare him for what was gonna happen & what kind of mental struggle he was yet to go through.

**The way we live right now is unhealthy, even tho the live the longest in the entire human history.** Our professions define our lives, which turns us into machines just like I wrote in [[The Industrialised Humans]]. We humans are always attached to our achievements, but we've always been ignoring the negative consequences that these "achievements". AI is amazing, but innocent human beings are gonna be the target. Fossil fuel is great, but it's turning the earth into an oven. Having a job is good, but it doesn't leave you with much time to spend with your loved ones, it makes you tired that even when you do have time for your children, you just wanna ignore them to relax yourself, and they would grow up in an environment that doesn't even provide the basic love they need from their parents.

**Bourdain was also industrialised.** He was a sucker who was stuck in travelling, who's peace got ruthlessly stripped away. Travelling for more than half 200 days a year non-stop is not natural, having to choose between family and work is not natural, seeing completely different parts of the world in such a short amount of time is not natural, absorbing all this information without having a way to reconcile and deal with it is not natural, shit, over night success that literally turns your life upside down and rushes you into a new life is extremely not natural. He was successful, but he also didn't survive.

But what does *surviving* mean anyways? Don't we all die in the end?

***Live dumb and happy. Or live educated and disappointed.*** You have to choose one from these two.

Maybe this would be the fate of all humans for the rest of humanity, maybe this has been the fate of all humans since we've become intelligent. Just like what the Eagles sang:

> You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave!
