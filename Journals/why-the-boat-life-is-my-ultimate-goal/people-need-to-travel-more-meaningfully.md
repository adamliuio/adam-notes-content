One of the undesired consequences of the booming of the travel industry is the huge increase of carbon emission, and the destruction of the beauty of the tourist attractions. Instead of enjoying the beauty of historical sites & local cultures, traveling for most people have become a money spending & photo taking journey so they can go back and show their friends where they've been, as well as enjoying a day of two of the life they saw in movies, sipping on apple martini by the pool in a resort compound, posing in front of the Eiffel Tower, shit like that. And of course, this is a no no for me.
