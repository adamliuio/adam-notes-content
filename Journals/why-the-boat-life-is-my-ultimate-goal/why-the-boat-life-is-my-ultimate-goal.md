> We are all wanderers, and we are all survivors.

We are all trying to build a better future for ourselves. We go to school, go to college, get jobs to make a living, try to get promoted, fall in love with the people that we think is right for us, give birth to babies to carry our hopes and dreams and love, and we do our best to provide everything for them.

Beyond our own interests, a lot of us also have bigger goals and dreams, trying to make the world a better place, doing our parts to help others, creating useful things to provide value to others, things like that.

In my last post - [[The Future Of My Life]] - touching on the boat life idea I have, I'm going to expand on this idea. And my last post was written more than 8 months ago, I've gone through huge emotional roller coaster during this period. And now, while my mentality has shifted to certain extent, the boat life idea has become much more important to me.

In my last post I briefly mentioned the *pro*s of the boat life:

1. You can travel the world in your house
   - this reconciles the conflicts between traveling the world while maintaining a sense of belonging).
2. You can travel to the untouched or the least touched land
   - I want to experience as much as possible, so this would include both the human cultures and the natural world, while most human cultures can be accessed by common transportation methods, some remote nature sightings can only be accessed by boat).

What I forgot to mention, are a couple of things I really care about and also made me believe this is the right choice for me:

1. I want to maximize my ***physical* & *mental* freedom**.
   - [[Physical Freedom: Being Able To Move]]
   - [[Mental Freedom: The Freedom To Think]]
2. I want to protect my peace of mind.

3. I don't want to be impacted by the drama other people have created.
   - It would be nice to have [[A life with no drama]]. I don't want to be a victim of human made drama.
4. I want to minimize the negative human & environmental impact that I personally have to deal with.
   - [[Avoiding the negative human & environmental impact]]
5. I want to be extremely flexible while having a sense of stability.
   - There is a way [[To Be Flexible And Stable At The Same Time]].
6. I want to minimize my carbon emission and travel meaningfully.
   - **Carbon emission**: Sailboats are pretty much the most eco-friendly transportation tools existing in my opinion, due to the reason it uses wind most of the time. So it would be the best choice of travel for anyone who wants to contribute the least to global warming.

Of course nothing is perfect in this world, so the boat life also has many *con*s:

- Things regularly break and malfunction on boats
- Sea sickness can be extremely tough
- Bad weather can make situations dangerous & fatal
- etc.

But you live and you learn, and with pressure you learn faster, taking risks and reaping the rewards is much better than having a 9-5 job and watching TV for the rest of my life.

I still have a long way to go, but I do believe this long road can be finished sooner if I run faster, which means I need to work harder & smarter.
