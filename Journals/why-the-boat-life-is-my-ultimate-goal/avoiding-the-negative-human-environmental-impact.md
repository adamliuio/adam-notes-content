title: "Avoiding the negative human & environmental impact"

I'm scared of climate change, not only because it will bring significant change to our lives, but also because the reason we are only starting to take it seriously now (2021), is because climate change is not only a climate issue, a significant part of it is the human politics. That's why I said ***"human & environmental impact"***. Now, I have no power to help in any aspect in terms of climate change on a big scale as an individual at the moment, while I do want to build my businesses asap and make sure I have enough time and money to help reducing climate change, I also want to have the safest way of life for my family. And a boat can also deliver it. Yes, the ocean is like a sensitive thermometer, it would be affected drastically, but in my opinion, the disastrous events happening in the ocean would be easier to avoid as a family when compared to sudden wildfires & toxic smokes when all your life belongings are in one house, and a car can only take so much luggage, not to even mention the blocked traffic when evacuating.

While a boat is definitely not the perfect solution, but it's definitely better than anything else I can imagine.
