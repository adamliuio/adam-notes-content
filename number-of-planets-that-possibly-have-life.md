title: Number of Planets That Possibly Have Life
---

<!-- !NEED EDIT! -->

The number of stars in our galaxy is around 100 – 400 billion, there are roughly an equal number of galaxies in the observable universe, so for every star in the colossal Milky Way, there’s a whole galaxy out there. All together, that comes out to the typically quoted range of between 1022 and 1024 total stars, which means that *for every grain of sand on every beach on Earth, there are 10,000 stars out there*.

The estimated percentage of “sun-like” stars (similar in size, temperature, and luminosity) range from 5% to 20% by different scientists. If we take the most conservative estimation (5%), and the smallest number of estimated total stars out there (10<sup>22</sup>), we would have:

10<sup>22</sup> × 5% = 500,000,000,000,000,000,000 (500 billion billion, 5e+20)

sun-like stars existing in the universe.

There are disagreements on the possibilities of earth-like planets (suitable for life to exist on base on our assumptions, that has similar temperatures, liquid water and other elements that would support life like on earth) orbiting these possible sun-like stars.

The latest (June 16, 2020) estimates suggests that [there can be as many as six billion Earth-like planets in our galaxy](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/06/200616100831.htm).

If during the billions of years that the universe exists, only 1% of Earth-like planets develop life (we'd have 60 million planets that have life), and if only 1% of those planets have life that have advanced to as intelligent as we are, we'd have 600,000 intelligent civilizations in our galaxy.
