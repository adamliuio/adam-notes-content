title: "Great Filter Theory: The Formation Of Life Itself"
---

Life only began (3.5 billion years ago) after around 1 billion years later after the earth was formed, which took 10 billion years after the universe was formed (about 13.8 billion years ago when the Big Bang banged), which means the happening of life is extremely rare, not to even mention for life to evolve into our level of intelligence.

The formation of life has gone through many stages, the simplified version for this context is this:

1. [Abiogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis) (also known as "origin of life"), is the natural process thatnonliving matter becomes living cells.
2. The process that simple prokaryotes (consist entirely of single cells) became more complex eukaryotes (which includes all complex life, i.e. animal, plant, fungus and alga).
3. The evolution of human intelligence.

The Great Filter could be the the appearance of life, this makes sense because life finally happened a billion years after Earth was formed. Which means, that the fact there's life on earth is a complete miracle, that life is extremely rare, and it's possible that we'll never find any other life form out there.

Or it could be the 2nd one, that the evolution from single cell organisms (prokaryotes) to multicellular organisms (eukaryotes) is extremely rare, which means, we will be able to find life on other planets, but it won't be anything we've imagined like in the movies or sci-fi books, but rather, alien life would be some kind of single cell organisms. But this is not rare, it even happened many times on earth.

Or it can be the appearence of human level intelligence. This has only happened once on earth through out history.

If you consider the above 3 possibilities, it wouldn't be hard to conclude that, we, as an intelligent life form, are the exception within exceptions. Because, a level below us, your pet dog, or even our relatives, chimps, are not even able to comprehend the concept of the "universe", and a level below that, cells, won't even be able to comprehend what animals can comprehend. So this would mean, not only there might not be any intelligent life out there, there might be no life out there at all.
