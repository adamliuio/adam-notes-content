[[The Univers Is Extremely Vast]] for our monkey brains to comprehend so far (AD 2021). You don't think so, then answer the question: [[Where are the aliens?]]

Not only the space is vast beyond our comprehension, it's also very lowkey, and isolated from most of what we think about every day. We tend to think Earth is the mother of us humans & everything we observe (which is pretty true), but you need something to make something, and where did mother Earth get all the materials to create us with? The very universe she belongs to. Believe it or not, as human beings, creatures of blood & flesh, [[We Are Mostly Stardust]].
