I've always found it weird that how much of our identities are defined by what we do. And this phenomenon has extended beyond workplaces. Imagine a casual convo at a party when one meets new people:

- "So John, what do you do for a living?"
- "Uhh, I'm a ### / Uhh, I do ###, and you?."

Of course not every convo is like this, but surprisingly a lot of the convos would touch on this point at the early stage when people socialise with strangers. Then how about the hobbies, the talents that you don't use to make money with, the experiences you've had that shaped your personality and world view? Nope. Very rarely when we think of someone we know of that's not our best friend, we would instinctively think of them as "a good father", "what an interesting gal", "she really put me into perspective". But rather, most of the time, one's profession is the first thing that comes to mind when we think of them.

The industrialisation of society seems not only to shape how societies work, but also shape how we view ourselves. We are like machines with price tags, but not machines like computers, which would do completely different things when you install different software, but rather machines like bulldozer, you're designed to dig, then you dig for your entire life. Very rarely do we install new "software" in to ourselves as well, learning new skills, trying different things, exploring different career paths, etc. Most people in this world have the view that they spent 4 years in college, what they've learned in their major should be the thing that they do for the rest of their lives.

And this is part of the reason most people are pretty boring.

Of course it's not all one's own fault. The biggest inequality existing today is the uneven access of information. If you're not exposed to the best ideas, or if you're exposed to the best ideas but don't have enough knowledge to understand them and expand & build upon them, then you're more likely to be locked in a small circle, and have very slim chances of improving your current situation.

While the internet treats most internet users fair and there is so much free useful information online, but the internet is a hunting ground of people's minds. Of course it's useful to learn the useful stuff for free whenever you want and wherever you are so you can have a better future, but it's way more fun to just endlessly scroll through social media, let algorithms fill up your brain with junks that give you instant pleasure.

At the end of the day, today's battle for most people (in most developed & developing countries), is not fighting for survival anymore. But rather, it's a battle for one's sanity.

> The ever-increasing complexity of today's world requires one to absorb & process much more information than most humans in previous generations, and this is extremely hard work.

The willingness to do the hard work in a smart way, if the ultimate differentiator of humans.
