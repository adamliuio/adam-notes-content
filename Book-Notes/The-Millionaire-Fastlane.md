## CHAPTER 1

If your road to wealth devours most of your active adult life and is not guaranteed, that road sucks. A “road to wealth” codependent on Wall Street and anchored by time with your life wagered as the gamble is a rotten alley.

The problem with accepted norms of retirement is what you do not see.

## CHAPTER 2

My new passion was automation and process.

Fast wealth is created exponentially, not linearly.

## CHAPTER 3

Your pursuit of wealth stalls when your focus is the road and its destination, and not the road trip. Sure, the Fastlane might open a rapid road to wealth, but a successful road trip will demand your respect for all of the trip’s vital tools.

When your focus is only the road, your journey is likely to stall and dreamy destinations never arrive.

If wealth has escaped you, it’s probably because you are “road- focused” and not using the whole formula.

You can’t crack wealth’s code with one variable in a multi- variable equation.

Millionaires Are Forged by Process, Not by Events

All self- made multimillionaires create their wealth by a carefully orchestrated process. They have and use the entire formula. Despite what you may have read or heard, wealth is not an event.

Wealth is a process, not an event.

Wealth creation has the same method of execution— a mixed collection of many disassociated ingredients into an consolidated whole that has value and is worth millions.

Wealth eludes most people because they are preoccupied with events while disregarding process. Without process, there is no event. Take a moment and reread that. Process makes millionaires, and the events you see and hear are the results of that process. For our chef, the cooking is the process, while the meal is the event.

The billion dollar “get rich” outcome is the event— the process is the struggle and the backstory.

All events of wealth are preceded by process, a backstory of trial, risk, hard work, and sacrifice. If you try to skip process, you’ll never experience events.

When you make your first million, it will be because of process and not some clandestine happenstance that just happened to waltz across your path. Process is the road trip to wealth: The destination shines as an event, but it’s found by process. Yes, the elevator to success is out- of- order— you will need to climb the stairs.

Your Roadmap (Parts 3, 4, and 5) The compass for the trip— your roadmap— is the guiding force behind your actions. Your roadmap pens your financial belief system and your preconceived convictions about wealth and money.

Much like a recipe, your roadmap will outline why, where, how, and what.

Your Vehicle (Part 6) Your vehicle is you. No one can drive the journey but you.

Your Roads (Part 7) Your roads are the career pathways you travel.

Just like a cross- country road trip, roads are plentiful with millions of permutations. Each carries with it a mathematical equation.

Your Speed (Part 8) Speed is execution and your ability to go from idea to implementation. You could sit in a Ferrari on an empty, straight road, but if you fail to hit the accelerator, you fail to move. Without speed, your roadmap has no direction, your vehicle stands idle, and your road mutates into a dead end.

The Road Trip Is Paved with Toll Roads Successful Fastlaners are warriors who live and die on rough roads. Toll roads pave the road to wealth, and that toll can’t be paid on Easy Street. For some of us, this is good news because the toll weeds out the weak and escorts them to the land of normal. If you resist the toll, wealth will resist you.

Expect a price to be paid. Expect risk and sacrifice. Expect bumps in the road. When you hit the first pothole (and yes, it will happen) know that you are forging the process of your unfolding story. The Fastlane process demands sacrifices that few make, to resolve to live like few can.

We live in a society that wants to outsource everything, from our household chores to raising our kids. Outsourcing might work for a dirty bathroom, but it doesn’t work for wealth.

Had someone gifted a Lamborghini to me (or any dream) when I was 16 years old, I wouldn’t be where I am today. When you are granted gifts without any effort, you effectively handicap process. The person I needed to become would have been dwarfed because process would have been outsourced. There is no wisdom or personal growth gained in a journey that someone else does for you. The journey is yours. And unless you find like- minded Fastlaners, you will walk it alone.

## CHAPTER 4

If you don’t know where you are going, any road will get you there.

If you don’t know where you are going, how will you know if you get there? An undefined destination means an undefined arrival. More than likely, you’ll end up where you don’t want to go. You find wealth with a roadmap, not a dartboard.

Self- made millionaires don’t become millionaires by stumbling into money. Likewise, financial failures don’t become failures by stumbling into poorness. Both are residual outcomes of the chosen financial roadmap and the actions and beliefs evolving from that roadmap. Your financial roadmap is definitive to process, and it’s the first tool for your road trip to wealth.

To change your choices it has to start from your roadmap because it is there where your beliefs lie, both literally and figuratively. Radical life disruption comes from a radical disruption in your roadmap. Change that, and you change everything.

Your belief system acts like a compass that, if errant, can lead you to a lifetime of detours. Fictitious beliefs are lying roadmaps; they escort you down dead- end roads where “Wealth: Next Exit” never happens.

The Sidewalk >— Poverty The Slowlane >— Mediocrity The Fastlane >— Wealth

Whichever financial roadmap you follow will predispose you to the destination inherent in the roadmap— the roadmap’s “true essence.”

Debt Perception: Does debt control you or do you control your debt? Or, do you even have debt? Time Perception: How is your time valued and treated? Abundant? Fleeting? Inconsequential? Do you work for time? Or does time work for you? Education Perception: What role does education have in your life? Does it have a role at all? Money Perception: What is money’s default position in your life? Is money a tool or a toy? Plentiful or scarce? Primary Income Source: What is your primary means of creating income? Primary Wealth Accelerator: How are you accelerating your net worth and creating wealth? Or are you? Wealth Perception: How do you define wealth? Wealth Equation: What is your mathematical plan for accumulating wealth? What wealth equation defines the physics of your wealth universe? Destination: Is there a destination? If so, what does it look like? Responsibility & Control: Are you in control of your life and your financial plan? Life Perception: How do you live your life? Do you plan for the future? Forsake today for tomorrow? Or tomorrow for today?

Each roadmap operates under a specific set of mathematical formulas, the wealth equation that determines the speed at which you can create wealth. Like Einstein’s E = MC ², these formulas govern your wealth universe much like physics governs our universe. And because physics is bound by mathematical absolutes, so are your equations (and probabilities) to wealth.

## CHAPTER 5

A Sidewalker’s financial destination doesn’t exist. The plan is to have no plan. Surplus money is immediately spent on the next great gadget, the next trip, the next newer car, the next fashionable styles, or the next hot fad. Sidewalkers are carelessly trapped in a “Lifestyle Servitude” fed by an urgent, insatiable need for pleasure, image, and instant gratification. This perpetuates an accelerating cycle of consumption, increasing the velocity of the burden, forever enslaving the Sidewalker to their job or their business.

If you’re older than 35 and you have less than $ 19,000 in net worth let me be blunt: What you are doing isn’t working. You need a new roadmap.

The Sidewalk offers no protection, because you’re naked and you can’t absorb the hits.

If you want to be unshakable on your financial road trip, you have to get tough and strap on a bulletproof vest. Your plan must transcend years of change and variability, not days.

A life on the Sidewalk naturally pulls you to poverty.

You can’t medicate poor money management with more money. Yes, you can look filthy rich and still be riding the Sidewalk dirty.

Financial discipline is blind to income.

The reason is, more money is not a solution to poor financial management.

Those lacking financial discipline misuse money to delay the inevitable.

Only a mindset change regarding money is a solution to money problems. To change your mindset, you must change your roadmap. Get off the Sidewalk and stop equating wealth to income and debt.

## CHAPTER 6

family (relationships), fitness (health), and freedom (choice). Within this wealth trinity is where you will find true wealth and, yes, happiness.

Wealth is strong- spirited familial relationships with people. Not just your family, but with people, your community, your God or spirituality, and your friends.

“Remember, no man is a failure who has friends.” This reflects on the importance of having your life shared with friends, family, and loved ones.

Second, wealth is fitness: health, vibrancy, passion, and boundless energy. If you don’t have health, you lack wealth.

wealth is freedom and choice: freedom to live how you want to live, what, when, and where. Freedom from bosses, morning alarms, and the pressures of money. Freedom to passionately pursue dreams. Freedom to raise your children as you see fit. And freedom from the five- day drudgery of doing things you hate. Freedom is the liberty to live your life as you please.

The problem with looking wealthy versus being wealthy is that the former is easy while the latter is not.

Wealth isn’t embodied in a car but in the freedom to know that you can buy it. Freedom to walk into the dealership, know your price, pay cash, and drive away.

Priorities: Some want to look rich, others want to be rich.

“Faux wealth” is the illusion of wealth without having it. It believes society’s definition of wealth. It’s not realizing that the pursuit of “faux wealth” does something terribly destructive: It destroys real wealth.

Wealth cannot be purchased at a Mercedes dealership, but the destruction of your freedom can.

The irony of looking wealthy is that it is an enemy to real wealth: It destroys freedom, it destroys health, and it destroys relationships.

## CHAPTER 7

That fact is, these analyses fall short because they don’t isolate the real thief of happiness: servitude, the antithesis of freedom. The irony is that when most people earn “more money,” it doesn’t add freedom, it detracts. By creating Lifestyle Servitude, more money becomes destructive to the wealth trinity: family, fitness, and freedom.

Debt and Lifestyle Servitude keeps people bound to work and unbound to relationships.

After basic needs are met (security, shelter, health, food), our happiness quotient is most significantly impacted by the quality of our relationships with our partners, our family, our friends, our spirituality, and ourselves. If we are too busy chasing the next greatest gadget to strike down the competitive opulence of the Joneses, we finance our misery.

Normalcy Is the Rat Race, a Modern- Day Slavery

You’re conditioned to accept normal based on society’s corrupted definition of wealth, and because of it, normal itself is corrupted. Normal is modern- day slavery.

Money doesn’t buy happiness when it’s misused. Instead of money buying freedom, it buys bondage. “Wealth” and “happiness” are interchangeable, but only if your definition of wealth hasn’t been corrupted by society’s definition. Society says wealth is “stuff,” and because of this flawed definition, the bridge between wealth and happiness collapses.

The fact is, there are plenty of poor people who live richer than their overworked upper- middle- class counterparts because the latter lack freedom, they lack solid relationships, and they lack health— all deleterious effects of working a hated job five days a week for 50 years.

1) Money buys the freedom to watch your kids grow up. 2) Money buys the freedom to pursue your craziest dreams. 3) Money buys the freedom to make a difference in the world. 4) Money buys the freedom to build and strengthen relationships. 5) Money buys the freedom to do what you love, with financial validation removed from the equation.

Affordability is when you don’t have to think about it.

Wealth, like health, isn’t easy. Both are cut from the same fabric with identical processes. They require discipline, sacrifice, persistence, commitment, and yes, delayed gratification. If you can’t immunize yourself from the temptations of instant gratification, you’ll be hard pressed to find success in either health or wealth. Both demand a lifestyle shift from short- term thinking (instant gratification) to long- term thinking (delayed gratification). This is the only defense to Lifestyle Servitude.

When instant gratification entices you to bite the bait, you become a casualty of the hook: Lifestyle Servitude. Instead of you owning your stuff, your stuff owns you.

## CHAPTER 8

I’m a great believer in luck, and I find the harder I work, the more I have of it.

Process creates events that others see as luck.

To take advantage of The Millionaire Fastlane understand that luck is a product of process, action, work, and being “out there.” And when you are “out there” you stand a chance at being in the right place at the right time.

If you want to be at the right place at the right time you indeed have to be at the right place— and the right place knows which places are the wrong places.

If you aren’t off the Sidewalk taking action and engaging in process, you will never realize luck.

Luck occurs when probability moves from impossible to likely.

Force your process out into the world and you can defy the odds of “being in the right place at the right time.”

To create luck, engage in processes so probabilities move from nothing, to something. Luck is introduced when you play. If you don’t play, you can’t win.

If you want luck, dive into process, because process raises events from the ashes.

## CHAPTER 9

Responsibility is the price of greatness.

Yet, the Sidewalker’s manifesto is predicated on hitchhiking: faith unto others, and when things don’t work out as intended, blame unto others. After faith in lucky events, blame is the third anchor to the Sidewalk.

The Law of Victims says you can’t be a victim if you don’t relinquish power to someone capable of making you a victim. When you abdicate control to others, you essentially become a hitchhiker with no seat belt. You take the passenger seat in a stranger’s car, which could be murderous to your financial plan. And when that happens, you’re vulnerable to joining the ranks of victims.

The road to victimhood is through denial: First responsibility, then accountability. People who don’t take responsibility are victims. Some of them are born victims and, instead of trying to improve their hand, they fold and give up. For them, everyone has the solution to their problems but them. And their problems? Not their fault.

In psychological parlance, this mental defect to assign blame externally is a condition known as an “external locus of control,” penned by American psychologist, Julian Rotter.

“Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country”

Wealth Demands Responsibility, Followed by Accountability Responsibility is the forefather to accountability, but one doesn’t evidence the other.

Accountability is culpability to consequences and modifying your behavior to prevent those consequences. You can be responsible while not being accountable.

“What kills me is when people make the same piss- poor choice multiple times but then claim to be responsible. It’s easy to be “responsible” when responsible means just walking away. I’ve seen single parents who pledge to be “responsible” for the wild oats they’ve sown, only to occasionally send a check in the mail. I’ve seen people walk away from homes, claiming to be “responsible” for their actions, only to buy another home they can’t afford. I’ve seen people being “responsible” for the actions their drinking and driving caused only to do it again! I am sick and tired of people being “responsible!” I want people to be accountable. People need to think before they act. Own their choices before they make them. I am okay with people making mistakes— but freaking own that you made a mistake and learn from it. That’s what true accountability and responsibility is all about.”

“Who’s the idiot, the idiot himself or the idiot that hires the idiot?”

Immunization for victimitis occurs when you are both responsible for AND accountable to your actions and the action’s possible poor consequences. Own your mistakes, failures, and triumphs. Reflect on your choices. Are you in a situation because you put yourself there? Did you error in the process? Were you lazy? Most bad situations are consequences of bad choices. Own them and you own your life.

No one can steer you off course, because you are in the driver’s seat. And when you own your decisions, something miraculous happens. Failure doesn’t become the badge of victimhood— it becomes wisdom.

You deserve what your actions earned, or haven’t earned. Being responsible is one thing; being accountable is another. When you’re accountable to your choices, you alter your behavior in the future and take the driver’s seat of your life.

## CHAPTER 10

What if I told you ‘insane’ was working fifty hours a week in some office for fifty years at the end of which they tell you to piss off; ending up in some retirement village hoping to die before suffering the indignity of trying to make it to the toilet on time? Wouldn’t you consider that to be insane?

While the Sidewalk is a lifestyle that mortgages the future for a comfortable today, the Slowlane is the antithesis: a sacrificial today in the hopes of a more comfortable tomorrow.

Unfortunately, the Slowlane is like bad directions given at a gas station, except these directions aren’t given by strangers, but by people you trust: teachers, television and radio personalities, financial advisers, and yes, even our parents. These ostensible sources reinforce the strategy’s fraudulent strength when its efficacy is a sucker’s bet. The Slowlane is a lifetime wager that a sacrificial today will yield a wealthier tomorrow.

The driving force behind Get Rich Slow is time— time employed at the job and time invested in the markets.

You can either live rich young or live rich old while risking death along the way. The choice is yours and it shouldn’t be a contest. Rich at 25 years old beats the snot out of rich at 65 years old.

Wealth is best lived young and enjoyed while you have health, vibrancy, energy, and yes, maybe even some hair. Wealth is best lived in the prime of your life, not in its twilight after 40 years of 50- hour workweeks have pulverized your dreams into surrender. Deep in our soul we know this, yet we continue to faithfully pledge obedience to a financial roadmap that *promises* wealth after four or five decades.

The plan is a failure because the plan is based on time and factors you can’t control.

The Slowlane is risky and insufferably impotent.

Unfortunately, wheelchairs don’t fit in the trunks of Lamborghinis.

While coupons and other Slowlane strategies aren’t worthless IN a plan, they shouldn’t be THE plan. The Slowlane as a total plan is the problem, not the Slowlane being a piece of the plan. This distinction is critical because financial discipline must accompany any wealth campaign.

Not even the greatest musician in the world can illuminate the blinding depths of the rat race and those suffocating by its indifference.

Life does not begin on Friday night and end Monday morning.

Wealth’s provenance evolves from the three Fs: family, fitness, and freedom.

Hopefully you recognize that five of anything in exchange for two is a bad return. The 5- for- 2 return on investment is a negative 60%. If you make consistent negative 60% return on investments, you’d go bankrupt quick. What logical person would accept such a horrific deal?

I don’t consider “settle for less” a strategy, which is why the Slowlane is predisposed to mediocrity. Life isn’t great, but it isn’t so bad either. No, it could be better . . . but you’ve got to swap the Slowlane for a new plan.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions
✓- The Slowlane is a natural course- correction from the Sidewalk evolving from responsibility and accountability.
✓- Wealth is best experienced when you’re young, vibrant, and able, not in the twilight of your life.
✓- The Slowlane is a plan that takes decades to succeed, requiring masterful political prowess in a corporate environment, frugality, and Wall- Street wizardry.
✓- For the Slowlaner, Saturday and Sunday is the paycheck for Monday through Friday.
✓- The default return on your time in the Slowlane is negative 60%— 5- for- 2.
✓- The 5- for- 2 trade inherit in the Slowlane is generally fixed and cannot be manipulated, because job standards are five days a week.
✓- The predisposed destination of the Slowlane is mediocrity. Life isn’t great, but it isn’t so bad either.

## CHAPTER 11

By working faithfully 8 hours a day, you may eventually get to be the boss and work 12 hours a day.

If you want to escape the Slowlane, find wealth and freedom fast, you’ve got to dump the job. Let me repeat. Dump the damn job! Jobs suck. I mean that generically, not targeted toward a specific job. Whether you’re an electrician or a store manager, you hold a job. Jobs suck because they’re rooted in limited leverage and limited control. Sure, you can have great job (and a fun one too!) but in the scope of wealth, they limit both leverage and control— two things desperately needed if you want wealth.

You sell your freedom to get freedom.

In a job, you sell your life for money. If you work, you get paid. If you don’t work, you don’t get paid.

One year your skill set has value, the next, it doesn’t.

job experience is usually organized into a core group of activities that is routinely repeated over and over again, day after day. After the initial learning experience, the job becomes regimented and accumulation of new knowledge creeps to a crawl. A job limits learning and mutates into life’s death knell: a trade of life force for money.

Experience comes from what you do in life, not from what you do in a job. You don’t need a job to get experience.

If you don’t control your income, you don’t control your financial plan. If you don’t control your financial plan, you don’t control your freedom.

If you are paying yourself last and everyone gets your money first, don’t expect to build wealth fast.

Your value is dictated, diminished, and delimited. Therefore the job becomes a delimiter on what’s important: wealth, freedom, and self- growth. And their limitations cannot be subverted.

A job seals your fate into a criminal time trade: five days of life traded for two days of freedom. A job chains you to a set grade of experience. A job takes away your control. A job forces you to work with people you can’t stand. A job forces you to get paid last. A job imposes a dictatorship on your income. These limitations are counter- insurgencies to wealth.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions
✓- In a job, you sell your freedom (in the form of time) for freedom (in the form of money).
✓- Experience is gained in action. The environment of that action is irrelevant.
✓- Wealth accumulation is thwarted when you don’t control your primary income source.

## CHAPTER 12

Somebody should tell us, right at the start of our lives, that we are dying. Then we might live life to the limit, every minute of every day. Do it! I say. Whatever you want to do, do it now. There are only so many tomorrows.

The Slowlane strategy is rooted in Uncontrollable Limited Leverage, or ULL (pronounced “yule”).

Intrinsic value is determined by the marketplace and is the price at which you can trade your time for money. Intrinsic value is what you earn working a job.

Intrinsic value is measured in units of time, either hourly or annually.

Your time is limited to small numbers and cannot be leveraged. “Hours worked” or “annual salary” are mathematically inept because they’re based on time measurements that cannot be controlled or manipulated.

Small numbers do not make millionaires.

Behind limited leverage is another corrosive wealth killer— no control.

Used correctly, “compound interest” is a powerful ally to wealth; used for Slowlane purposes and it bogs the wealth road trip to a crawl.

Wealth creation via compound interest requires the passing of time and lots of it. Like a job, compound interest, or market investments such as stocks and indexed- funds can’t be leveraged nor can they be controlled. They rely on deficient math to create wealth.

What don’t they tell you? They don’t tell you that a 15% return year- after- year is impossible unless you invest with Bernie Madoff or Charles Ponzi. They don’t tell you that in 40 years you’ll be dead, and if you’re not, you’ll be close. They don’t tell you that in 40 years, your $ 2.5 million will likely be worth $ 250,000 in today’s dollars and that a pack of gum will cost $ 6.00. They don’t tell you that this method of wealth acceleration is NOT what they use. They don’t tell you plenty, and yet you’re supposed to believe it without question.

Compound interest demands that your investments yield a predictable 10% return per year. Good luck with that 40- year gamble. Have the markets ever lost 20% in one year? Or 40%? They have, and when they do, your hard- earned savings evaporate.

wealth acceleration via compound interest is deficient because its variables are deficient. Neither time nor yield can be leveraged or controlled.

Time is restrained by the years in your life, yield is restrained by the average yield of typical market investments, and sum is limited because your means of creating income comes from a job— also limited! The only way to subvert the mathematical weakness of compound interest is to start with a large number, and large numbers require leverage!

Additionally, like a job, you can’t control compound interest.

Folks, you don’t want millions to accompany your cane, you want it to accompany your youth.

Every day, people sacrifice their time for tiny nuggets of wealth, where time is the liability and not the asset. Anything that steals time and doesn’t have the power to free time is a liability.

If you want to get rich, you have to control and leverage the variables in your financial plan— any financial plan without control immediately disintegrates into a plan of hope.

Wealth is built with time as an asset, not as a liability!

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions
✓- Slowlane wealth is improbable due to Uncontrollable Limited Leverage (ULL).
✓- The first variable in the Slowlane wealth equation stems from a job that factors to intrinsic value which is your nominal value for each unit of your life traded.
✓- Intrinsic value is the value of your time set by the marketplace and is measured in units of time, either hourly or yearly.
✓- In the Slowlane, intrinsic value (regardless of its time measurement) is numerically inhibited because there are only 24 hours in the day (for the hourly worker), and the average lifespan is 74 years (for the salaried worker).
✓- Like the Slowlaner’s primary income source (a job), the Slowlaner’s wealth acceleration vehicle (compound interest) is also pegged to time.
✓- Like a job, compound interest is mathematically futile and cannot be manipulated. You cannot force- feed the market (or the economy) to give you phenomenal returns, year after year.
✓- Wealth cannot be accelerated when pegged to mathematics based on time.
✓- Time is your primordial fuel and it should not be traded for money.
✓- Your time should not be an expendable resource for wealth because wealth itself is composed of time.
✓- Your mortality makes time mathematically retarded for wealth creation.
✓- If you don’t control the variables inherent in your wealth universe, you don’t control your financial plan.

## CHAPTER 13

The only thing that interferes with my learning is my education.

If my skills erode in practicality based on technological evolution, my education becomes deprecated and my value to society plummets accordingly.

Consider the statistics. In 2007, the Washington Post reported that, according to Nellie Mae, the big student loan service provider, by the time college students are seniors, 56% of them will have four or more credit cards with an average balance of $ 2,864. According to a research report by Demos- USA.org, a public policy research and advocacy organization, people in the 18– 24 age bracket spend nearly 30% of their monthly income on debt repayment. This is double from 20 years ago. A survey of college borrowers found that the average college senior graduated with nearly $ 19,000 in student loan debts, and graduate degree pursuers more than $ 45,000. A 2007 Charles Schwab survey revealed that teenagers believe when they get older they will earn an average salary of $ 145,000. The reality? Adults with a college degree earned an average of $ 54,000. Unfortunately, the future isn’t so bright that you have to wear shades. The truth behind reality and expectation is about a $ 100,000 chasm. This disparity might explain why the debts of our youth have exploded as they bridge reality to expectation. If I can’t make $ 145,000, I can look like I make $ 145,000!

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions
✓- Slowlaners attempt to manipulate intrinsic value by education.
✓- Indentured time is time you spend earning a living. It is the opposite of free time.
✓- Parasitic debt is debt that creates indentured time and forces work.

## CHAPTER 14

There was a time when a fool and his money were soon parted, but now it happens to everybody.

A Paradox of Practice exists when someone promotes a moneymaking strategy but that strategy is not what made him or her rich. In other words, they’re not practitioners of their own advice.

In the game of money, money is the scorecard. If someone tells you how they “scored,” make sure they disclose their real wealth methods, not the illusion concealing the real culprit.

Folks, the rich use the markets for income and wealth preservation— not to create it!

If the “do as I say” doesn’t match the “do as I do”, you should be suspicious.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions
✓- Take advice from people with a proven, successful track record of their espoused discipline.
✓- Many money gurus often suffer from a Paradox of Practice; they teach one wealth equation while getting rich in another. They’re not rich from their own teachings.

## CHAPTER 15

I’d rather live in regret of failure than in regret of never trying.

Wealth by the Slowlane roadmap is analogous to Exodus, the biblical story of Moses. God leads Moses out of Egyptian bondage into a harrowing 40- year journey through the desert, with the promise of a triumphant future in the land of “milk and honey.” After a lifetime of toil and struggle, Moses arrives at the doorstep to his destination and— wham! He dies. He never sees the promise of the

To assume that you will live a long, healthy life is arrogant. To assume that life won’t throw you any curves is naïve. For the Slowlane to prevail, it assumes life is predictable and forgiving.

If you lob a little logic into the Slowlane narratives you’ll find that it’s extremely hazardous and a plan based entirely on hope. Assumptions— decades of them— expose the Slowlane’s true risks. Choose to travel the road and choose to gamble.

The Slowlane begs you to settle and become a miser.

For example, in 2008– 2009, the equity markets lost nearly 60%. If you saved for 15 years and amassed $ 100,000, it would now be worth $ 40,000. It would take you 14 years at 8% yearly returns just to get back even! That equates to almost 30 YEARS GONE! And this doesn’t account for inflation, which makes your $ 100,000 more like $ 50,000!

Slowlaners often revert to the Sidewalk. Why? Hope over control. When you can’t control time, your job, or five days of your life each week, you feel powerless. Emotions of helplessness create an environment ripe for instant gratification and Lifestyle Servitude. A study published in 2008 by the Journal of Consumer Research found that when people feel powerless and out of control, they have a strong desire to buy things that convey a high status. Why do they feel powerless? Simple. In the Slowlane, you relinquish control because time is in control and the gates to the Sidewalk reopen. Hope is not a plan.

a Slowlaner will try to manipulate his weak mathematical universe by trying to make the variables malleable.
✓- Manipulate intrinsic value by increasing hours worked. (I need to make more money!)
✓- Manipulate intrinsic value by changing jobs or adding jobs. (I need to get paid more!)
✓- Manipulate intrinsic value by going back to school. (I need a better career!)
✓- Manipulate compound interest by seeking better investment yields. (I need better investments!)
✓- Manipulate compound interest by expanding investment time horizon. (I need more time!)
✓- Manipulate compound interest by increasing the investment. (I need to save more!)

You can’t overcome mathematical limitations. A car that has a top speed of 10 mph will always have a top speed of 10 mph, no matter HOW HARD YOU PUSH THE ACCELERATOR. If you travel across the country at 10 mph, you’re going to need 40 years!

The Slowlane is predisposed to mediocrity because the numbers are always mediocre.

The Slowlane is risky because its variables are uncontrollable and leverage is absent. ULL really means “ULL” never get rich. Yet, lifestyle is the one variable Slowlaners can effectively manipulate. Unfortunately, this quickly turns Slowlane life into a stale exhibition of misery. Yes, settle for less.

Hoodwinking expenses does not create wealth. Exploding income and controlling expenses creates wealth.

Income explosion and relative expense containment created wealth.

So what happens when a Slowlaner commits to the expense variable? Life becomes about what you can’t do.

In a 2002 AARP (formerly the American Association of Retired Persons) survey, 69% of the respondents said they would need to work past retirement age. A year earlier, 45% said they would need to work into their 70s and 80s. Fifteen years later, a 2017 Gallup Poll revealed this number to be now 74%. We can deduce something disturbing from this data: The Slowlane’s failure rate is nearly 75%.

Slowlane winners are usually extremely talented, elderly, or overworked.

Fame and notoriety carries a high intrinsic value. People pay extraordinary rates for you or your services. (Even if, like a reality- show star, you have no skills.)

You can defy the Slowlane’s limitations by becoming so indispensable that your value to society skyrockets. If millions seek you, you will be paid millions. Pro basketball player LeBron James is paid millions because his skills are in short supply. Famous actors and entertainers are paid millions because millions demand their brand in entertainment form. Extreme talent is paid extremely well.

Slowlane millionaires who don’t escape by fame or corporate prostitution live differently. They own homes in innocuous middle- class neighborhoods. They drive unassuming cars like Hondas or Toyotas, they vacation infrequently, they limit their dining expenses, they cut coupons, and they max out their retirement accounts. They work five days a week at jobs they most likely hate and diligently save 10% of their paychecks. Others own small businesses, franchises, and retail stores. Several international best- selling books have enlightened us: Yes, these are the “millionaires next door.”

12 Distinctions Between Slowlane and Fastlane Millionaires 1) Slowlane millionaires make millions in 30 years or more. Fastlane millionaires make millions in 10 years or less. 2) Slowlane millionaires need to live in middle- class homes. Fastlane millionaires can live in luxury estates. 3) Slowlane millionaires have MBAs. Fastlane millionaires hire people with MBAs. 4) Slowlane millionaires let their assets drift by market forces. Fastlane millionaires control their assets and possess the power to manipulate their value. 5) Slowlane millionaires can’t afford exotic cars. Fastlane millionaires can afford whatever they want. 6) Slowlane millionaires work for their time. Fastlane millionaires have time working for them. 7) Slowlane millionaires are employees. Fastlane millionaires hire employees. 8) Slowlane millionaires have 401( k) s. Fastlane millionaires offer 401( K) s. 9) Slowlane millionaires use index- funds and Wall Street instruments to get rich. Fastlane millionaires use them income, liquidity, and capital deployment. 10) Slowlane millionaires let other people control their income streams. Fastlane millionaires control their income streams. 11) Slowlane millionaires are cheap with money. Fastlane millionaires are cheap with time. 12) Slowlane millionaires use their house for net worth. Fastlane millionaires use their house for residency. The Fastlane isn’t about becoming the next middle- class millionaire with tiresome mandates about what you cannot do; it’s about what you can do.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions
✓- The Slowlane has seven dangers, five of which cannot be controlled.
✓- The risk of “lifestyle” is the one risk Slowlaners will try to control.
✓- The Slowlane is predisposed to mediocrity because its mathematical universe is mediocre.
✓- Slowlaners manipulate the “expense” variable because it is the one thing they can control.
✓- Exponential income growth and expense management creates wealth— not just by curtailing expenses.
✓- You can break the Slowlane equation by exploding your intrinsic value via fame or insider corporate management.
✓- Successful Slowlaners not famous or in corporate management end in the middle . . . middle class and middle age.
✓- Slowlane millionaires are stuck in the middle class.
✓- $ 10 million is the new $ 1 million.
✓- A millionaire cannot live a millionaire lifestyle without financial discipline.
✓- Lottery winners fall into the millionaire trap and go broke because they attempt to live a “millionaire” lifestyle, not understanding that a few million doesn’t go very far.

## CHAPTER 16

People would do better, if they knew better.

What Is the Fastlane? The Fastlane is a business and lifestyle strategy characterized by Controllable Unlimited Leverage (CUL), hence creating an optimal environment for rapid wealth creation and extraordinary lifestyles. Definitively, pay attention to these four segments: 1) Controllable Unlimited Leverage (CUL) Whereas the Slowlane is defined by uncontrollable variables with no leverage, the Fastlane exploits the opposite conditions: maximum control and leverage. 2) Business Your own business, self- employment, and entrepreneurship are centrist to the Fastlane, much like a job is to the Slowlane. 3) Lifestyle The Fastlane is a lifestyle choice: a commitment of blended beliefs, processes, and actions. 4) Rapid Wealth Creation The Fastlane is about creating large sums of wealth rapidly and beyond the confines of “middle class.”

The Fastlane Mindposts Like the other roadmaps, the Fastlane Roadmap contains the same mindposts or behavioral characteristics that drive the Fastlaner’s actions along the journey. They are: Debt Perception: Debt is useful if it allows me to build and grow my system. Time Perception: Time is the most important asset I have, far exceeding money. Education Perception: The moment you stop learning is the moment you stop growing. Constant expansion of knowledge and awareness is critical to my journey. Money Perception: Money is everywhere, and it’s extremely abundant. Money is a reflection of how many lives I’ve touched. Money reflects the value I’ve created. Primary Income Source: I earn income via my business systems and investments. Primary Wealth Accelerator: I make something from nothing. I give birth to assets and make them valuable to the marketplace. Other times, I take existing assets and add value to them. Wealth Perception: Build business systems for cash flow and asset valuation. Wealth Equation: Wealth = Net Profit + Asset Value Strategy: The more I help, the richer I become in time, money, and personal fulfillment. Destination: Lifetime passive income, either through business or investments. Responsibility & Control: Life is what I make it. My financial plan is entirely my responsibility and I choose how I react to my circumstances. Life Perception: My dreams are worth pursuing no matter how outlandish, and I understand it will take time and money to make those dreams real. These mindposts are what formulate the Fastlaner’s lifestyle. It drives action.

The Fastlane Roadmap: Predisposed to Wealth The Fastlane Roadmap is predisposed to wealth because it operates under a wealth equation with controllable, unlimited variables, and the mathematical cage of time is removed. ULL is replaced with CUL. Correctly exploited, the roadmap reveals a rapid road to wealth via unlimited mathematics evolving via “profit” or “asset value” or both. This rapid wealth accumulation extricates years from the wealth journey because time is removed or exploited during the process. The Fastlane produces wealth in short periods— millions, sometimes billions of dollars. Yes, it’s true: “Get Rich Quick” exists.

The distinction is that “get rich schemes” aren’t endemic of “Get Rich Quick” but its evil twin, “Get Rich Easy.” “Get Rich Easy” shadows its innocent sibling, leaving a trail of victims to be blamed by its brother. “Get Rich Easy” parades in the limelight and on Instagram feeds with pictures of beaches, palm trees, and used Ferraris. It lies, deceives, and casts a mirage of vanity that all desire. Just watch buy this $ 197 PDF or buy this stock software program, and wham, you will be rich in 10 days! No! That’s not “Get Rich Quick” but “Get Rich Easy”— and that only leads to a lighter wallet.

✓- The inventor who creates a gadget and sells millions of them to 15 wholesale distributors.
✓- The YouTuber with thousands of subscribers who monetizes it into a subscription service or a product offering.
✓- The guy who builds a cell phone application and sells it 50,000 times.
✓- The guy who formulates an energy bar to help him stave off hunger and later is offered $ 192 million for his company.
✓- The guy who builds a blog and three years later sells it for $ 4 million to a big pharmaceutical company.
✓- The woman who invents a mop and sells 500,000 of them on QVC.

✓- The guy who patents a product process and then licenses it to a Fortune 500 company and goes on to make $ 14 million.
✓- The guy who creates a website to help him listen to his favorite basketball team and later sells the company for $ 5.5 billion.
✓- The guy who builds a software company and later becomes the richest man on the planet.
✓- The doctor who researches anti- aging treatments and sells them to a drug company for $ 700 million.

✓- The entrepreneur who refines and improves a product process and goes on to sell $ 150,000/ month through a variety of channels, including Amazon.
✓- The guy who creates a $ 20K/ month supplement business allowing him to travel the world and later sells it for $ 560K.

The Industrial Revolution was a historic period when humans learned how to leverage the speed and efficiency of machine- based manufacturing. Manual labor was replaced by systems, a union of distinct parts that coalesced into a specific production outcome. Long and arduous tasks manually handled by humans transformed into mechanization, expelling most human labor out of the production equation. For that era, it was their version of “Get Rich Quick.” Products that formerly took months to manufacture now took days.

Likewise, financial freedom via the Fastlane Roadmap is like an industrial revolution for wealth. The default road to wealth is manual labor, a fight against time and intrinsic value. The rapid road to wealth is to industrialize the wealth process, to systematize it like our ancestors systematized production.

The revelation destroys Azur. He spent years doing the heavy lifting while Chuma built a machine to do it for him. Instead of honoring the machine, Azur stubbornly vows, “I must get stronger! I must lift heavier stones!” Azur continues the hard labor of pyramid building while Chuma continues to work the crank of his machine. After eight years, Chuma finishes his pyramid at age 26: three years to build the system and five years to reap the benefits of the system. The great pharaoh is pleased and does as promised. He rewards Chuma with kingship and endows him with great riches. Chuma never has to work another day in his life.

The Fastlane Is a Business System: The Slowlane Is a Job The Slowlane is a job: your hard work traded for your employer’s cash. Azur’s struggles resemble that of a Slowlaner; to get rich, you’re told to get stronger (spend money, return to school, and earn more in the job market) so you can lift heavier stones. The Fastlane is about building a better system, a better contraption, a better product, or a better “something” that will leverage your work. In the Slowlane, you are the source of heavy lifting, while in the Fastlane, you construct a system that does it for you. On your wealth road trip, the Slowlane roadmap asks that you endure a long, tiresome walk to wealth. The toil of wealth is the process itself. In the Fastlane, wealth is driven in a business system you create— the toil is the creation and management of the system itself.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions
✓- The risk profile of a Fastlane strategy isn’t much different from the Slowlane, but the rewards are far greater.
✓- The Fastlane Roadmap is an alternative financial strategy predicated on Controllable Unlimited Leverage.
✓- The Fastlane roadmap is predisposed to wealth.
✓- The Fastlane Roadmap is capable of generating “Get Rich Quick” results, not to be confused with “Get Rich Easy.”

## CHAPTER 17

A man wrapped up in himself makes a very small bundle.

Losing teams use losing playbooks. Play for a losing team and you’re stuck using their losing playbook. To win, switch teams and use the winner’s playbook.

The winning team is Team Producer. Reshape life’s focus on producing, not consuming. When you reframe your thinking from majority thinking (consumer) to minority thinking (producer), you effectively switch teams and allegiances.

Yes, become a producer first and a consumer second. Applied, this means instead of buying products on TV, sell products. Instead of digging for gold, sell shovels. Instead of taking a class, offer a class. Instead of borrowing money, lend it. Instead of taking a job, hire for jobs. Instead of taking a mortgage, hold a mortgage. Break free from consumption, switch sides, and reorient to the world as producer.

However, once you see the world from a producer perspective, your perception sharpens like a fine- tuned radio frequency, from static to clear stereo sound. Suddenly, opportunities have clarity, ideas surface, and scams are exposed. This new minority status is critical to strengthening your wealth- creation temperament. Remember, the rich are a minority, and you want to be in that minority. It starts with a producer mindset.

As producers, our job is to entice consumers to buy. As a producer locked into a producer mindset, I attract wealth because consumers seek producers. Consumers are the majority who demand their fill!

Once you succeed as a producer, you can consume anything you want with little consequence because you’ll be rich. To consume richly, produce richly first. Unfortunately, most people have it backward: consumption and no production. Producers get rich. Consumers get poor. Switch teams and reorient as a producer first, a consumer second. Make wealth attracted to you!

To switch teams and become a producer, you need to be an entrepreneur and an innovator. You need to be a visionary and a creator. You need to give birth to a business and offer the world value.

it’s important to note that most small business owners are light years away from a Fastlane and dickering with Slowlane metrics. Some businesses masquerade as jobs!

A Fastlane business is the key to the Fastlane wealth equation (Wealth = Profit + Asset Value) because it unlocks LEVERAGE, a new set of wealth variables that are unlimited and controllable, whereas in the Slowlane, they are limited and uncontrollable. Yes, ULL is swapped for CUL.

when you unlock yourself from the handcuffs of time imposed by the Slowlane roadmap, you assign income to a system that leverages unlimited mathematics, and fast wealth becomes possible.

The variables in my wealth universe can be controlled and leveraged.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions
✓- Producers are indigenous to the Fastlane roadmap.
✓- Producers are the minority as are the rich, while consumers are the majority as are the poor.
✓- When you succeed as a producer, you can consume anything you want.
✓- Fastlaners are producers, entrepreneurs, innovators, visionaries, and creators.
✓- A business does not make a Fastlane— some businesses are jobs in disguise.
✓- The Fastlane wealth equation is not bound by time and its variables are unlimited and controllable.

## CHAPTER 18

Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go.

Wealth = Net Profit + Asset Value

Underneath this equation lies the true power of the Fastlane and how to build wealth fast. Its variables are controllable and unlimited. If you can manipulate the variables inherent to your wealth equation, you can get wealthy.

Net Profit = Units Sold × Unit Profit

Asset Value = Net Profit × Industry Multiple

Limitless variables = high speed limit = high potential income.

Small numbers have a strong gravity toward mediocrity.

almost all penta- millionaires made their fortunes in a big lump sum after a period of years. Worth repeating: a big lump sum, not “by saving 10% of his paycheck for 40 years.” “A big lump sum” is just another phrase for “asset value.” Furthermore, 80% either started their own business or worked for a small company that saw explosive growth. Explosive growth is another phrase representing asset value. And yet, none of these multimillionaires had a cushy union job down at the DMV.

The primary wealth accelerant of the rich boils down to one concept: Appreciable and controllable assets. Within our Fastlane wealth equation, this second component is called “Asset Value.” Asset value is simply the worth of any property you own that has marketplace value.

The rich accelerate wealth by accelerating asset value and selling those upgraded assets in the marketplace.

Asset Value = (Net Profit) × (Industry Multiplier)

Any time an asset has sustainable profits, an industry multiplier governed by prevailing market conditions determines the asset’s value. Other people or companies will buy that asset based on the asset’s net profit multiplied by the assessed multiple.

Industry multipliers are subject to intense negotiating as they rise and fall with the economy and within industry sectors.

Stocks trading on the public markets define the multiplier for each respective company by the price- to- earnings ratio, or PE. If a company’s stock trades at 10 times PE, investors are purchasing that company at a multiple of 10 times. Price- to- earnings is relevant regardless of whether your company is a small private company or a large publicly traded company:

The valuation of your company is predicated on the subjective PE for your particular industry.

Breaking news: 8% and 40 makes millionaires in 40 years: 1,700% and 16 million makes billionaires in four years.

Zealous pursuit of net profit is a double- flanked attack at creating wealth. Since asset value is tied to net profit, raising net profit simultaneously elevates asset value by the average industry multiple. Of course, this works in the opposite as well; if your company stalls and net income falls, so will the corresponding asset value.

In the Fastlane, your Wealth Accelerator is based on creating or buying appreciative assets, adding value and manipulating the variables, and then selling.

Liquidation events create millionaires overnight, but only if liquidation occurs. Liquidation events are the process of selling your appreciable asset to the market. It’s a Fastlane exit strategy.

Asset valuations of businesses, real estate, and other appreciable assets are nothing, but just that— valuations based on subjective analysis and market data.

Illiquid, paper- millionaires can’t buy Ferraris and palatial estates; money does. And to get the money, you have to increase profit and save it, or go for the big exit: liquidation.

Fastlaners accelerate wealth by building cash- flowing assets that can be sold in the marketplace to realize gains. Their wealth equation has controllable, unlimited leverage.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions
✓- The key to the Fastlane wealth equation is to have a high speed limit, or an unlimited range of values for units sold. This creates leverage. The market for your product or service determines your upper limit.
✓- The higher your speed limit, the higher your income potential.
✓- The primary wealth accelerant for the rich is asset value, defined as appreciable assets created, founded, or bought.
✓- Wealth creation via asset value is accelerated by each industry’s average multiplier. For every dollar in net income realized, the asset value multiplies by a factor of the multiple.
✓- Your industry of specialization will determine the average multiple that determines your wealth accelerant factor. If the multiple is 3, your WAF is 300%.
✓- Liquidation events transform appreciated assets (“ paper” net worth) into money (“ real” net worth) that can be transformed into another passive income stream: a money system.

## CHAPTER 19

Time is the coin of your life. It is the only coin you have, and only you can determine how it will be spent. Be careful, lest you let other people spend it for you.

When your wealth is predicated on factors that you cannot control and that are implicitly limited, you aren’t going to make fast progress. You aren’t in control, because time is in control. You aren’t in control, because the boss is in control. You aren’t in control, because the stock market is in control.

The beauty of passive income is it doesn’t care if you’re 20 years old or 80. If your monthly income exceeds your lifestyle expenses including taxes, guess what? You’re retired!

To Break Time Is to Grow a Money Tree

Money trees are business systems that survive on their own. They require periodic support and nurturing but survive on their own, creating a surrogate for your time- for- money trade.

A money tree is a business system, and it’s the Fastlane roadmap’s Main Street. Money trees create passive income streams BEFORE you “officially” retire. Yes, you can experience the destination of retirement and financial freedom without actually being retired.

Appreciative assets (asset value) are cornerstones in the Fastlane wealth equation.

Rental systems can come from a variety of other sources: leases, royalty payments, and licensing are other forms of “rental systems” that can produce reoccurring income.

Rental systems are powerful money trees because they are high on the passivity scale and survive time.

Computers are miraculous inventions and fertile seeds to money trees.

What sets the Internet apart from real estate is it implicitly contains leverage. When you own a website, you’re accessible to millions. When you own a three- bedroom home on Elm Street, it’s accessible to a few. This duality makes Internet systems one of the best business seedlings in existence.

Ms. Rowling recalls the happiest point of her life— not the acquisition of millions, but the point at which she could write full- time.

Change creates millionaires. Those who see the changes and take advantage of it will become the new millionaires and billionaires. And because change is constant, millionaire opportunities also remain constant.

A distribution system is any structure or organization designed to move products to the masses. Distribution systems can be hybrids with the other seedlings, such as content and computer systems.

When inventing any product, the invention is always half the battle. Distribution is the other. The greatest product in the world goes unused if it isn’t leveraged into the proper distribution system— either one that exists, or one that you create.

Distribution is a means to move product to the masses. Some systems are better than others and when it comes to distribution, it all depends on the control structure. If you create a network marketing company to sell your new vitamin product, you are creating a powerful distribution network capable of earning millions. If you join a network marketing company, you are electing to be a gear in the distribution process.

Savvy Fastlane entrepreneurs recognize that a successful local business with weak leverage can be made highly leveraged by franchises or chains.

I knew adding employees would erode business passivity because employees need management. At a certain level, even managers need managers.

Good employees nurture money trees. Bad employees pluck the fruit of money trees and require pruning. However don’t let that stop you. If you want to make millions or billions, human resource systems (employees) will be needed. While solopreneurs can make a lot of money, you can’t do everything yourself. At some point, managing your time and growth has to take precedence.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions
✓- To divorce yourself from the Slowlane’s transactional relationship of “time for money,” you need to become a producer, specifically, a business owner.
✓- Business systems break the bond between “your time for money” because they act like surrogate operatives for your time trade.
✓- If you have a passive income that exceeds all your needs and lifestyle expenses including taxes, you’re retired.
✓- Retirement can happen at any age.
✓- The fruit from a money tree is passive income.
✓- A Fastlane objective is to create a business system that survives time, exclusive of your time.
✓- The 5 money- tree seedlings are rental systems, computer systems, content systems, distribution systems, and human- resource systems.
✓- Real estate, licenses, and patents are examples of rental systems.
✓- Internet and software businesses are examples of computer systems.
✓- Authoring books, blogging, and magazines are forms of content systems.
✓- Franchising, chaining, network marketing, and television marketing are examples of distribution systems.
✓- Human resource systems can add or subtract to passivity.
✓- Human resource systems are the most expensive to manage and implement.

## CHAPTER 20

The rich rule over the poor, and the borrower is slave to the lender. ~ Proverbs 22: 7 (NIV)

The best money tree in existence sits right in your pocketbook: The good old- fashioned buck. Yes, money. Money is the king of money trees.

How is money passive? If you have a lot of money, you’re given the gate key to switch teams from consumer to producer. Specifically, you move from borrower to lender. You move from employee to employer. You move from customer to owner. In other words, people pay you to use YOUR MONEY in the form of interest or ownership.

Savers aren’t losers. Savers are winners because they eventually become lenders. Savers are winners because they become owners in companies. Savers are winners because they become producers and build assets.

One dollar has the power to give you a nickel of passive income for life. Yes, for life. While one nickel buys squat, it unlocks the DNA implicit in money— it’s fully passive.

And since inflation rises in unison with interest rates, my income has an element of inflation protection. If inflation rises, so do interest rates.

Instead of trading my time for dollars, I invested my time into an autonomous system simultaneously capable of passivity and capable of funding my money system. It was a dual- flanked attack where passive income was both the short and long term goal.

Every dollar saved is another freedom fighter in your army. If your money is fighting for you, your time is freed and you break the equation of “time for money.” Money is your army. The more you have, the more they will fight for freedom.

Fastlaners think globally, not locally.

Make money fight for you instead of you fighting for money.

Slowlaners (the middle- class) use compound interest to get wealthy while Fastlaners (the rich) use it to create income and liquidity. Slowlaners start with $ 5; Fastlaners start with $ 5 million.

Compound interest pays me a lot of money. It’s a tool I use. It’s a great passive income source. Yet, compound interest is not responsible for my wealth. This is critical. Fastlaners aren’t using compound interest to build wealth, because it’s not in their wealth equation. The heavy lifting of wealth creation is left to their Fastlane business.

When a rich politician or public figure discloses his finances, notice the common themes. Their wealth comes from business interests, while liquid cash reserves are tied into fixed- income securities like municipal bonds, treasuries, and other highly liquid investments. The rich aren’t using the markets to create wealth; they’re increasing their existing wealth with leveraged business assets. Remember, that 25- year- old multimillionaire who got rich investing in indexed- funds is a fairy tale. The millionaires are the guys running the funds! They’re the producers!

For compound interest to be effective, you must bypass 30 years of mathematical ineptitude by riding the crest where it is effective.

Like a tidal wave far out to sea, compound interest’s strength isn’t visible until it moves near land. As the wave approaches land, its force becomes incredibly powerful.

The Fastlaner observes the tidal forces near land and seeks to meet it at the shore. At the shore, the tidal wave can be ridden with impact.

The point of this illustration is to show that the rich aren’t using compound interest to get wealthy; they’re using it for income, liquidity, and capital deployment. A 5% tax- free yield on $ 10 million suddenly creates a $ 500,000 per year passive income.

Like a tidal wave at the seashore, compound interest rears excruciating force when pitted against large sums of money. This is where money transforms into a fully passive income stream.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions
✓- One saved dollar is the seed to a money tree.
✓- A mere 5% interest on $ 10 million dollars is $ 40,000 a month in passive income.
✓- A saved dollar is the best passive income instrument.
✓- Fastlaners (the rich) don’t use compound interest or the markets to get wealthy but to create income, preserve liquidity, and deploy capital.
✓- A saved dollar is a freedom fighter added to your army.
✓- The rich leverage compound interest at its crest, applied against large sums of money.
✓- Fastlaners eventually become net lenders.

## CHAPTER 21

Try not to become a man of success, but a man of value.

Math is law. “Secrets” and mystical philosophies are not. If you want to get rich, start observing the true law of the universe— MATH— and not some hocus- pocus law that can neither be proved nor documented. Singing positive platitudes around the campfire isn’t going to make you rich.

Events of wealth sell. Process does not.

The “Flaw of Attraction” is that it ignores mathematics.

The Law of Effection states that the more lives you affect in an entity you control, in scale and/ or magnitude, the richer you will become. The shortened, sanitized version is simply: Affect millions and make millions.

Impact millions and make millions. It doesn’t get any simpler than that! In other words, how many lives have you touched? Who has benefited from your work, your assets, and your handiwork? What problems have you solved? What value are you to society? If you’re working the front desk at a hotel, you simply aren’t making much of an impact, and your bank account will represent that same fact. The amount of money you have (or don’t have) is a direct reflection on the amount of value you have provided (or not provided).

Effection Is Scale, Magnitude, or Both To exploit the Law of Effection, your business needs to make an impact of either scale or magnitude, or both. Within our Fastlane wealth equation, “scale” and “magnitude” are implicit to our “net profit” variable.

NET PROFIT = Units Sold (Scale) × Unit Profit (Magnitude)

Magnitude is always reflected by an item’s price. High value = high price = high magnitude.

Scale creates millionaires. Magnitude creates millionaires. Scale and magnitude creates billionaires.

Show me any self- made billionaire and I will show you a person who has touched the lives of many in scale or magnitude, directly or indirectly. To Woodward and Bernstein, Deep Throat said, “Follow the money,” and when you do, you find the only one true law of wealth, and that is Effection. Why? Because Effection is rooted in mathematics, and because of this it operates exclusive of any roadmap.

Retrace the source of millionaire money and you will find millions of something.

Effection of scale or magnitude always precedes money, either directly or indirectly. The more lives you impact, directly or indirectly, the more wealth you will attract.

If you want to get rich via intrinsic value, you must do it via the Law of Effection. Get into a position to impact millions. Become indispensable and irreplaceable like an athlete, entertainer, or a top- brass executive.

The Law of Effection doesn’t care about roadmaps or time trades or anything but the mathematical power of large numbers. Make a giant impact a few times or make a small impact millions of times.

The closer you get to the source of large numbers, the closer you will get to wealth. To serve millions is to make millions. Think big to earn big.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions
✓- The Law of Effection states that the more lives you affect or breach, both in scale or magnitude, the richer you will be.
✓- Scale translates to “units sold” of our profit variable within our Fastlane wealth equation. Magnitude translates to “unit profit” of our profit variable within our Fastlane wealth equation.
✓- The Law of Attraction is not a law, but a theory. The Law of Effection is absolute and operates exclusive of a roadmap.
✓- All lineages of self- made wealth trace back to the Law of Effection.
✓- The Law of Effection’s absoluteness comes from direct access and control (you are the athlete) versus indirect access (you are the athlete’s agent).
✓- To make millions you must serve millions in scale or a few in magnitude.

## CHAPTER 22

Events and circumstances have their origin in ourselves. They spring from seeds which we have sown.

Fastlane success demands a well- tuned vehicle primed and prepared for the journey that awaits. You are the vehicle to wealth. You are impetus for action and progress. You are responsible for the journey and the first step in taking charge of you, is to own you.

For “pay yourself first” to be legitimate, you truly need to pay yourself first in infinite amounts and the government last. You must own your vehicle.

To Pay Yourself First, You Must Own Yourself You can’t pay yourself first if you don’t own yourself. Your vehicle (you) must be free and clear. When you have a job, someone owns you. And when someone owns you, you aren’t paid first, but last.

The first step to controlling your vehicle— you— is to own yourself so you’re paid first and the government last. That is accomplished by forming your business into a corporation that you control. The corporation serves as the Fastlane frame because it offers the immediate tax benefit of “pay yourself first” versus “pay yourself last.” When you own a corporation, net profits are reduced by expenses. The remaining profit is taxed, and those taxes are paid to the government. Additionally, corporations exist separate from their owners and survive time. It’s the surrogate structure that serves as your business system.

Assuming a US- based business, the best business structures for your Fastlane business are: 1) C corporation 2) S corporation 3) Limited liability corporation Each has its advantages and disadvantages, but all share two common benefits: limitation of liability and tax efficiency.

The C Corporation The C corporation is a business structure that survives time and can be easily transferred. Corporate profits are taxed at corporate income tax rates, with net income distributed to shareholders. Some C- corp owners use this structure to deploy a strategy known as “income splitting.” The strategy is to partition the business’s income to both the owner and the business, effectively lowering the tax bracket of the two, versus a large income for just one. While it’s not within the scope of this book to dive into tax strategy and corporate formation, it does offer up a Fastlane component, which is control. While C corporations and their owners are subject to double taxation (tax on corporate profits and dividends to shareholders), they are advantageous for larger corporations and corporations with an “asset growth” strategy. In other words, if you don’t plan on distributing profits and are focused on building “asset value” over “net profit,” C corporations do the job. The majority of publicly traded companies are C corps that do not distribute dividends to their shareholders. They grow revenue and asset value.

The S Corporation An S corporation is like a C corporation except that it isn’t taxed as a separate entity. Considered a “pass- through” entity, taxes aren’t paid at the corporate level, but at the individual level and reflected on the owner’s personal tax return. S corporations also have some tax advantages because profits are not subject to the hefty self- employment tax that comes with sole proprietorships. However, unlike C corporations, which can have limitless owners, S corporations are limited to 100 owners and will have additional filing requirements.

The Limited Liability Corp (LLC) An LLC operates just a like a corporation with the benefits of a partnership or a sole proprietorship. LLC profit passes through to its owners, called members, and is reflected on their personal income tax. LLCs are also considered “pass- through” entities because profit passes directly to the owners. For partnerships, the LLC or the S corp is the recommended structure in lieu of a general partnership, which, again, does not offer liability protection.

For small startups, I recommend looking into either an LLC or an S corp. Personally, I steer clear from partnerships and sole- proprietorships, as they might not limit liability.

Selecting an entity depends on your goals and your vision for your business. Here are some general questions to help you decide. = > What is your exit strategy? Go public? Sell to private investors? = > What is your growth strategy? = > What is your liability exposure in the worst case? = > Do you plan on raising capital now, or in the future? = > Do you plan to hire employees? = > Do you plan to take on new partners? = > Do you plan on earning profits fast? Or not for a while?

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions
✓- “Pay yourself first” is fundamentally impossible in a job.
✓- To own your vehicle (you), start a corporation that formally divorces you from the act of business. Your corporation is the body of your surrogate.
✓- The recommended Fastlane business entity is a C corp, an S corp, or an LLC.

## CHAPTER 23

Your life is the sum result of all the choices you make, both consciously and unconsciously. If you can control the process of choosing, You can take control of all aspects of your life. You can find the freedom that comes from being in charge of yourself.

If you retrace poverty’s footprints you will find that poorness starts at the exact same place: choice. The leading cause of poorness is poor choices.

The problem is poor diet; cholesterol is the symptom.

If you aren’t where you want to be, the problem is your choices. Your circumstances are the symptoms of those choices.

Fastlane isn’t something you try, it’s something you live. It isn’t one choice but hundreds. And when you line a string of choices together, they create your process, and your process will create your lifestyle. Lifestyle choices will make you a millionaire.

Your choices spark the fires of future circumstances. The fabric of your life is sewn by the cumulative consequences of your choices— millions of them— that you set into motion. You act, react, believe, disbelieve, perceive, misperceive, and all of it engineers your existence. If you’re dissatisfied with life, your choices take full responsibility. Blame yourself and the choices you’ve made.

I chose all of it, and it engineered my life to that exact moment. I awoke to the epiphany that I was the driver of my life and my problems were the consequences of my choices. I steered myself there!

There’s a big chasm between thinking wealth and choosing wealth. You can choose the Sidewalk, the Slowlane, or the Fastlane. You can choose to align your life with greater purpose, or choose to let life live you. You can choose to believe these theories or choose not to. The common denominator is CHOICE and YOU.

Your steering wheel (choice) is the most powerful control you have in your life. Why do I hate the Slowlane? Because it denies choice and gives it to someone else— the company, the boss, Wall Street, the economy, and a bunch of others.

People don’t choose to be poor. They make poor decisions that slowly assemble into a poorness puzzle. Retrace the footprints to poverty and it happens slowly, systematically, and methodically, under a steady diet of poor choices.

Treasonous choices are actions that do irreparable harm to your life, your dreams, and your goals. The consequences of treasonous choices throw life onto unintended detours and hazardous roads that are difficult to escape and often times, permanent.

His choices loaded the gun but someone else pulled the trigger.

Your life’s steering wheel is a dangerous weapon. Three inches is all it takes. Jerk your life’s wheel three tiny inches while speeding and you can steer your life onto a path of no return, or worse, smack into a concrete wall. Like an automobile’s steering wheel, your choices are super- sensitive. Unfortunately, treasonous roads always have a green light. People drown in the misery of their own choices while neglecting to acknowledge they are the cause.

You’ll see.

Our choices have consequences that transcend decades. This transcendence is horsepower. Every day my discomfort reminds me of that fateful day when I chose poorly. And today, I’m still paying the mortgage of that choice, a mortgage that never amortizes.

When you make minor permutations (choices) that deviate from your initial conditions, profound effects transpire over time.

A bad choice can set your trajectory off by only one degree today, but over years the error is magnified.

Choices have this type of divergence over time and it’s called “impact differential.” When your choices are extrapolated throughout the years, the divergence widens. The divergence can be either positive or negative.

Recognize that every day you make decisions that will ripple through the years. Question is, will your choice ripple to happiness and wealth? Or depression and poverty?

Your choices have significant trajectory into the future, and the younger you are, the more horsepower they exude. Unfortunately, horsepower fades with age.

Your life’s choices are like a mature oak tree with millions of branches. The branches symbolize the consequences of your choices. Near the trunk of the tree, the branches are thick, reflecting the decisions you’ve made early in life, while the top branches are thin, symbolizing decisions near the end of your life. Youthful choices radiate the most strength and fabricate the trunk of your tree. As the branches ascend topside through time, they get thinner and weaker. They don’t have enough power to bend the tree in new directions because the trunk is thick with age, experience, and reinforced habits.

You can’t decide to “go Fastlane” because that itself is just an event. A Fastlane process is hundreds of choices.

Regardless of age, reflect on your life and analyze the forks in the road and where those forks have taken you. The forks are choices, both large and small, and each shares the common thread of having the magnificent power to take you somewhere different. Whatever you decide today impacts tomorrow, weeks, months, years, decades, and yes, generations.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions
✓- The leading cause of poorness is poor choices.
✓- The steering wheel of your life is your choices.
✓- You are exactly where you chose to be.
✓- Success is hundreds of choices that form process. Process forms lifestyle.
✓- Choice is the most powerful control you have in your life.
✓- Treasonous choices forever impact your life negatively.
✓- Your choices have significant horsepower, or trajectory into the future.
✓- The younger you are, the more potent your choices are and the more horsepower you possess.
✓- Over time, horsepower erodes as the consequences of old choices are thick and hard to bend.

## CHAPTER 24

Until we see what we are, we cannot take steps to become what we should be.

We have two types of choices: 1) Choices of perception (thought patterns) 2) Choices of action (choosing to read)

Choices of perception precede choices of action. If you believe and perceive a certain idea, you are likely to act on that belief.

The first step in making better choices starts with your choice of perception, because your actions evolve from those perceptions.

The choice of perception and its choices start right between your ears and drive themselves into choices of action.

Money is infinite. Fastlane opportunists can drive opportunities that yield six and seven figures monthly. The difference is perception.

Earning $ 1 million in one month is possible if you make the right choices and drive the right Fastlane roads. This perception leads to better choices of action. That guy at the party? He chose a crowded road. Instead of creating a multilevel marketing company, he joined one. Instead of serving the masses through Effection, he joined the masses.

Your internal language carries weight.

Altering your words and thought perceptions are akin to wiping your windshield clean and seeing beyond your bubble. How do you manage your choice of perception? What language do you use in your mind? “I never… I can’t . . . If only . . .” Or do you choose better words? “It’s possible . . . I’ll overcome . . . I will . . . I can.” If your world is canvassed with words like “never” and “can’t,” guess what? It’s true— you can’t and you never will!

Is it possible to earn $ 1 million in one month? Sure it is, just ask the guy who does it. What makes his windshield different from yours? Good choices of perception translate into good choices of action. To change your perception is to change your future actions.

Believe that retirement at any age is possible. Believe that old age is not a prerequisite to wealth. Believe that a job is just as risky as a business. Believe that the stock market isn’t a guaranteed path to riches. Believe that you can be retired just a few years from today.

Find the information, resources, and the people that align with the new beliefs.

If you want extraordinary results, you’re going to need extraordinary thinking. Unfortunately, “extraordinary” is not found trapped in society’s mediocracy and the beliefs that fuel them.

As your journey progresses, respect yourself and ask, is this a good choice of perception? A good choice of action? Is this going to be treasonous to my dreams and cloud my windshield to a better life? Have I chosen to be a victim or a victor? Have I accepted challenge or surrendered?

Changing your life starts with changing choices. The Fastlane vehicle to wealth is driven on choice, not asphalt. You start making better choices using two strategies dependent on the decision’s gravity. 1) Worse Case Consequence Analysis (WCCA) 2) Weighted Average Decision Matrix (WADM) WCCA is designed to steer you away from perilous detours and treasonous choices. Conversely, WADM is designed to help you make better big decisions with multiple contingencies. This dual- pronged attack works on the choice extremes: a prevention of disastrous choices and a facilitator of good choices.

Worse Case Consequence Analysis (WCCA) The first decision tool is Worst Case Consequence Analysis (WCCA), which requires you to become forward- thinking and an analyzer of potential consequences. WCCA asks you to answer three questions about every decision of consequence: 1) What is the worst- case consequence of this choice? 2) What is the probability of this outcome? 3) Is this an acceptable risk? While these three questions might seem lengthy, your analysis process shouldn’t take longer than a few seconds. You don’t need a pen or paper, just your head and a conscious choice of perception. When choices are analyzed using WCCA, potential disasters are exposed and alternatives chosen. Treasonous roads can be avoided.

The Weighted Average Decision Matrix (WADM) Ever wrestle with a tough decision? One day you favor option A and the next day you flounder back to option B. Wouldn’t it be great if making a tough decision were a simple as picking the higher number? The second decision tool I use compares and quantifies big decisions. You know them: Should you move or stay? Quit or continue? Go back to college or not? For WADM, you need paper and a pencil. Or, you can visit HelpMyDecision.com and let the web work the calculation for you. Keep in mind, WADM is for big decisions, so you might use this a few times a year whereas WCCA can be used daily. With WADM, decision- making is easy as it isolates and prioritizes factors relevant to your decisions and then quantifies each decision with a value. The higher value reflects the better decision. For example, if you had a choice between moving to Detroit or Phoenix, WADM would yield a simple numerical valuation like Detroit 88 and Phoenix 93. Based on the number, Phoenix is the better choice. While WADM is subjective and requires your unfettered objectivity, it is a great tool for identifying which choice is more favorable to your preferences. To use WADM, a minimum of two choices is needed, but it could be used for more. Let’s say you do indeed live in Detroit and are considering moving to Phoenix. You struggle with the decision and can’t get clarity. One day you want to move, the next you want to stay. Usually, this waffling occurs when there are too many decision factors within each choice. Get a pencil and paper. Make three columns on your paper, one headed “Factors” and the other two for each choice, “Detroit” and “Phoenix.”

Today is the starting line for the rest of your life. Yes, today is the tomorrow you worried about yesterday. The problem with the past is that we remember memories we shouldn’t, and we don’t forget what we should. If your eyes are stuck in the rearview mirror, you’re stuck in the past. If you’re stuck in the past, you’re not looking ahead. If you’re not looking ahead, you can’t hit the mark of your future. The universe doesn’t care about your past. It is blind to it.

One person and one person only weaponizes past transgressions: you. If the universe doesn’t remember, why should you?

Your past never equals your future unless you allow it. Think about a coin flip. No matter how many times it’s flipped, the next flip is always random. Probability cannot be attached to a future flip based on the past. Your past is the same. Just because you failed at five relationships doesn’t mean your next will fail, especially if you learn from them! Just because you flipped burgers three hours ago doesn’t mean you can’t be a millionaire next year. The universe forgets, just like the universe forgot I mopped floors and delivered pizza not long ago.

Your memories carry the same makeup as your choices. They’re treasonous, muted, or accelerative. Unlike choice’s consequences, you have a choice how your past is classified. The records of the past can be sealed.

You have a choice in framing failure and the past. It serves or hinders.

While the consequences of our choices can’t be manipulated, you can manipulate your memories to serve you. My life is not defined by being picked last in high school gym class. If you’re defined by your past, it will be impossible for you to become who you need to be in the future.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions
✓- Your choices of action manifest from your choices of perception.
✓- What you choose to perceive, or not perceive, will manifest itself to a choice of action, or inaction.
✓- You can change your choice of perception by aligning yourself with those who experience the perception as reality.
✓- Worst Case Consequence Analysis helps avoid treasonous choices.
✓- The Weighted Average Decision Matrix (WADM) can help you make better big decisions by clarifying alternatives and their internal factors.
✓- The universe has no memory, only you do.
✓- Your past can be accelerative or treasonous. You choose the classification.
✓- If your eyes are transfixed to the past, you can’t become the person you need to become in the future.

## CHAPTER 25

Ridicule is the tribute paid to the genius by the mediocrities. ~ Oscar Wilde

Before they could even pursue flying, the Wright brothers had to break free of society’s natural headwind— the natural social conditioning that poisons all young minds.

We must not hear the naysayers, because they have been conditioned by society. Society will grind a constant headwind at your vehicle’s grille. You can’t worry about deviating from social norms, because the norm is to be two paychecks from broke. If you want to push beyond average results produced by average people, you’ll need to adopt an uncommon approach that doesn’t fall in the favor of “everyone.” The more uncanny and exceptional you strive to be, the more you need to fight through social indoctrination.

Extraordinary wealth will require you to have extraordinary beliefs.

Going Fastlane and building momentum will require you to turn your back at the people who spew foul headwinds in your direction. You have to break free of society’s gravitational force and their expectations. If you aren’t mindful to this natural gravity, life can deteriorate into a viscous self- perpetuating cycle, which is society’s prescription for normal: Get up, go to work, come home, eat, watch a few episodes of Law and Order, go to bed . . . then repeat, year after year. Before you know it, 45 years have passed and you need another 25 just to make your financial plan work. Time passes, dreams die, and what remains?

Who farts headwinds? They are: 1) Friends and family who just don’t get it. 2) Media and educational institutions who preach Slowlane dogma. 3) Parents who are conditioned to believe wealth is for other people. 4) Slowlane gurus who claim your house is the best investment. 5) Slowlane gurus who say $ 100 invested today will be worth $ 10 million in 50 years. 6) Your environment.

As a producer, you are the minority, while consumers are the rest. To be unlike “everyone” (who isn’t rich), you (who will be rich) require a strong defense; otherwise, their toxicity infects your mindset. Commiserating with habitual, negative, limited thinkers is treasonous. Uncontrolled, these headwinds lead directly to the couch and the video game console. Yes, the old, “If you hang out with dogs, you get fleas.” This dichotomy makes you a blossoming flower that needs protection, water, and plenty of sun. Negative friends, family, or coworkers are dark clouds. Defend yourself or suffer the consequence of slow assimilation to mediocrity.

Sly was no stranger to the Law of Effection. One of the telling elements of Sly’s success story was his resistance to getting a “normal” job. He mentioned that if he’d taken a corporate job, his dream would have died because he knew the gravity of a job was inescapable for him. He recognized a corporate environment was a headwind.

If your environment puts a stiff headwind in your face, you must take proactive steps to remove the headwind. What headwinds are blocking your dreams? Take control and make choices that can shift the trajectory of your life.

When you associate with people who empower your goals, you create a wind at your back and build momentum. Positive people nurture your growth, sooth your failures, and invest in your dreams. Good people are conduits to your dreams, not just in motivational fuel, but in extending your opportunely reach. People are like roads— they can either bring opportunity or distress into your life. The quality of these roads solely depends on the quality of the person. Think of the relationships in your life like an army platoon readying for battle. Who are you going to war with? Your friend Mark who is always late, lies, and passes out drunk every Saturday night? Your friend Lucy who has a new job every three weeks, was caught forging checks, and is only looking for a super- rich guy to carry her off into the sunset? Are these people you can count on? Are these the people you want to go to battle with? If not, you need to pick better warriors to have on your team. How? Join entrepreneur clubs, attend networking events, ally yourself with like- minders, get yourself around people who subscribe to a Fastlane, anything- is- possible mindset, and decide who you want on your team of warriors. Read books and autobiographies of those who have the kind of success you want. Find a mentor. Join entrepreneur forums with a Fastlane mindset, like the Fastlane Forum!

Folks, this is war and your life is in the balance. You need warriors who are impervious to the Death Star and can deactivate the Slowlane tractor beam, not fearful pansies who drop their cargo at the first sign of Imperial Slowlaners. Reflect on your environment and your relationships, and recognize the headwinds. Then choose accelerative action: Can these headwinds be removed, ignored, or managed? Unlike natural wind, you are the arbiter of your headwinds. Success follows those who break the headwind and put it at their back.

The worst headwind can be the person who sits in your vehicle’s passenger seat. They sit and lecture you on your dumb ideas and remind you of your failures. Or they don’t say anything and just distract you:

significant others (spouses, fiancées, girlfriends, boyfriends) can be some of the biggest headwinds out there. Having a life partner who doesn’t ascribe to your ideals and goals is like towing a trailer full of wet manure. If your partner doesn’t subscribe to an entrepreneurial philosophy and toes the Slowlane road, can you expect to grow together? Someone fighting with you in your corner is accelerative; if they oppose, they become treasonous.

Bad relationships are roadblocks to Fastlane success. They drain energy and dim dreams. It’s like rowing a boat upstream. Unwilling passengers add weight, distract, and sometimes are expensive to remove. Yes, divorce is treasonous and expensive, both emotionally and financially. Traveling down the road less traveled is already difficult. Why compound the journey by weighing down the car with someone who doesn’t share your destination? Are you in the right relationship with a person who believes in you and your goals? Or is your relationship just like lukewarm water, not bad, not good, just comfortable enough to stand pat? If so, it might be time to evaluate your passenger.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions
✓- The natural gravity of society is not to be exceptional, but average.
✓- Toxic relationships drain energy and detract from your goals to be extraordinary.
✓- The people in your life are like your comrades in a battle platoon. They can save you, help you, or destroy you.
✓- Good relationships are accelerative to your process, while bad relationships are treasonous.

## CHAPTER 26

Time isn’t a commodity, something you pass around like a cake. Time is the substance of life. When anyone asks you to give your time, they’re really asking for a chunk of your life. ~ Antoinette Bosco

These people value their time at zero. It’s free. Like the air we breathe, they’re convinced that time is abundant and in endless supply. They live as if they were immortal. They are certain that time, the fuel of their life, never runs empty.

Value your time poorly and you will be poor. When time is wasted as a lifestyle choice you will be stranded in places you don’t want to be.

Life sucks. Life needs an escape. Life is no good. Show me someone who spends hours online playing Clash of Clans or Candy Crush, and I’ll show you someone who probably isn’t very successful. When life sucks, escapes are sought. I don’t need television because I invested my time into a real life worth living, not a fictitious escape that airs every Tuesday night at 8 p.m.

Again, majority thinking yields mediocrity, and for that majority, time is an asset that is undervalued and mindlessly squandered.

“Your money can’t save you anymore than it can save me.” Reflect on that for a moment. Your money can’t save you anymore than it can save me. Powerful.

You see, once your time is gone, you’re dead. And when your clock ceases to tick, no amount of cash will save you from the end.

Fastlaners understand that time is the gas tank of life. When the gas tank runs dry, life ends. Time is the greatest asset you own, not money, not the 1969 restored Mustang, not grandpa’s old coin collection. Time.

Time is the great equalizer. You were born with a full tank of gas. There are no refilling stations, and your one fill- up occurred the moment you took your first breath. Time can’t be created outside of your mortal limits.

within mortality, time is transformed from infinite to finite. The greatest theft of all humanity is to act as if our time on this Earth is infinite when it isn’t.

The reality is that time is deathly scarce, while money is richly abundant.

On any given day, $ 3 trillion is exchanged in the world currency markets. That’s $ 3,000,000,000,000. To give that perspective, you can spend a million dollars a day for 8,000 years and you still wouldn’t have spent $ 3 trillion. That’s 109 lifetimes to quantify the total currency trading volume that exists for ONE DAY.

You can always acquire more money, but you cannot defy mortality. The irony of financial fortune is that no matter how much you have, you’ll die flat broke. You cannot escape time’s continual combustion as your tank bleeds away every second. You can live in blissful happiness or in a miserable depression— time is indifferent and it just drips away.

There are two types of time that will make up your lifespan: Your free time and your indentured time. Your Lifespan = Free Time + Indentured Time

“Indentured time” is the opposite: It’s the total time spent earning money and the consequences of that spent time. When you awake in the morning, shower, dress, drive to the train station, wait, ride to work, and then work for eight hours— this is indentured time. When you spend your entire weekend “recharging” from the workweek, this is indentured time. Indentured time is actual work and the work you must do for the work. Morning rituals, traffic, compiling reports at home, solitary “recharges”— whatever time spent earning a buck is indentured time.

Money buys free time and eliminates indentured time.

the irony of your free time is it isn’t FREE; it’s bought and paid for by your indentured time. You enjoy a two- week vacation because it was paid by a year of indentured time. You can relax with a cold beer on the couch because you paid eight hours of indentured time earlier in the day.

Indentured time becomes the ransom of your free time.

There’s the right time and the wrong time. The right time is free time; indentured time is the wrong time. The Slowlane ransoms time— time at the job and time invested in the markets. Remember, five indentured days for two free days is a bad trade! A financial plan with time as the linchpin is not a good plan.

on our road trip to wealth, we’re guilty of adding weight. Our vehicle is burdened with junk- in- the- trunk that coerces us to work harder. And when you work harder long enough, it wears you out and breaks you down. This debilitating weight is parasitic debt. Parasitic debt is everything you owe the world. It is the excrement of Lifestyle Servitude.

When you’re forced to work, you limit choice, and limited choices close roads. Aside from my mother’s creepy doll collection, nothing is more frightening than a parasite leeched to my neck, sucking my blood. Parasitic debt is a counterweight to your road trip; it’s a bloodsucker that steals free time, energy, freedom, and health— all foes to true wealth.

The leading cause of indentured time is parasitic debt. Surely you’ve heard the phrase “thief of hearts.” When it comes to parasitic debt, it is the “thief of lives.”

Parasitic debt is a gluttonous pig that gorges on free time and shits it out as indentured time. Any debt that forces you to work is expensed from free time and shifts it to indentured time. Debt needs a constant drip of blood, and that blood comes from your gas tank of life: time. And since time is fixed, an increase in indentured time comes from only one source: your free time.

because total time is finite, indentured time grows by pilfering from free time. Indentured time leads to the Sidewalk.

Control parasitic debt by controlling its source: instant gratification, a trait of the Sidewalk.

While some choose servitude behind iron bars, others choose servitude behind velvet walls. Both are the same. The ultimate wealth is having the free time to live how you want to live. The Fastlane is about being both lifestyle rich as well as time rich.

Time is the planet’s ultimate equalizer.

Time losers are also inconvenient savers. The inconvenient saver desperately clutches onto every dollar, fearful it may never return. Extreme inconvenience is never a match for saving money.

Fastlaners exalt time as their primary consideration in decision- making because it’s our most valued asset. Fastlaners are frugal with time, while Slowlaners are frugal with money.

Time is king.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions
✓- Fastlaners regard time as the king of all assets.
✓- Time is deathly scarce, while money is richly abundant.
✓- Indentured time is time you spend to earn money. Free time is spent as you please.
✓- Your lifespan is made up of both free time and indentured time.
✓- Free time is bought and paid for by indentured time.
✓- Fastlaners seek to transform indentured time into free time.
✓- Parasitic debt eats free time and excretes it as indentured time.
✓- Lifestyle extravagances have two costs: the cost itself and the cost to free time.
✓- Parasitic debt has to be stopped at the source: instant gratification.

## CHAPTER 27

Education is what remains after one has forgotten everything he learned in school. ~ Albert Einstein

The Fastlane road trip demands fresh oil changes. But what is oil? Oil is education. Knowledge. Street smarts. But be careful . . . it must be the right oil and for the right purpose.

Face it. What you know today is not enough to get you where you need to be tomorrow. You must constantly reinvent yourself, and reinvention is education.

Education, your oil, is a critical component to your wealth road trip. When you continually inject yourself with new education, new skills, and new competencies, new roads open and things run smoothly. The right education has incredible horsepower. New opportunities rarely follow an old education.

Education is virtuous under both Slowlane and Fastlane roadmaps, but their roles are profoundly different. In the Slowlane, education is used to elevate intrinsic value, while in the Fastlane it is used to facilitate and grow the business system. Also, Fastlane education is secured by methods that do not produce parasitic debt or conformity. The purpose of education within the Fastlane is to amplify the power of the money tree and the business system. You’re not a cog in the wheel; you learn to build the wheel.

Make the real world your university. Yes, you are your own university.

Ask any successful entrepreneur and they will validate this truth: You learn from engagement, from doing, and from getting out and taking repeated action, more so than from any book or professor.

In today’s information society, there is absolutely no excuse not to find out how.

Education didn’t end with graduation, it started. And best of all, my self- taught education was a twin- turbo acceleration into the Fastlane; my skills didn’t come loaded with parasitic debt or conformity.

Education is free for your consumption. Infinite knowledge is at your fingertips and the only thing preventing you from getting it is you. Yes, YOU.

You have the innate power to become an expert at anything not requiring physical talent. Anything! No book in the world can make me a professional singer or a basketball player, but books can transfigure novices to experts in nonphysical disciplines.

Skills and expertise are waiting just for you. No one drops a book on your lap and gifts knowledge. You have to seek it, process it, and then use it. The acquisition and application of knowledge will make you rich.

The best investment you can make is in yourself. So be willing to pay for your education now, or be prepared to pay a much bigger price for your lack of education later. The choices you make today will determine your financial future. Be sure you make the right choice, because you will have to live with the results of that choice.

The rich understand that education doesn’t end with a graduation ceremony; it starts. The world is in constant flux, and as it evolves your education must move with it or you will drift to mediocrity.

While time might be linear, it can be manipulated by performing double- duty on one time block, as in the old cliché, “Killing two birds with one stone.” Maximize time and you maximize wealth. Accomplish two objectives in one time frame. Make life your university.

I can’t stress enough that the more knowledge you consume, the more torque you create on the Fastlane road trip.

Where’s your bailout? Let me tell ya, walk into the bathroom, flip on the light- switch and look in the freaking mirror. There’s your bailout.

No one cares. You’re in debt because you borrowed. You’re in debt because you bought into the scripted lie and relinquished control. You bought the Slowlane. Were you forced to take loans? You don’t have a job because you voted for politicians who penalize producers and reward consumers. Face facts.

People are lazy. People want it handed to them. They don’t want to read and connect the dots. They want to be steered and hand- held, or even better, have it done for them entirely. People want events, not process, and what better event than a $ 50,000 seminar!

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions
✓- Fastlaners start their education at graduation, if not before.
✓- A Fastlaner’s education serves to advance their business system and their money tree, not to raise intrinsic value.
✓- Fastlaner’s aren’t interested in being a cog in the wheel. They want to be the wheel.
✓- I don’t know how” is an excuse dismantled by discipline.
✓- Infinite knowledge is everywhere and it’s free. What’s missing is discipline to assimilate it.
✓- You can become an expert in any discipline not requiring physical skills.
✓- Educational recharges can occur within time blocks already allocated for other objectives.
✓- Organizers of expensive seminars take advantage of Sidewalkers and disenfranchised Slowlaners by marketing empty promises as “events.”

## CHAPTER 28

If things seem under control, you are just not going fast enough. ~ Mario Andretti

Winners are forged at the Redline. What’s the Redline? The Redline is pure, unadulterated commitment. Money trees, businesses, and systems aren’t built overnight. It took Chuma years to construct his pyramid machine. Commitment is money- tree water, sun, fertilizer, and cultivation. I know commitment is a word likely to cause a riotous exodus. If you think Fastlane process is easy, stop now and go back to the Slowlane, which isn’t easy either!

The creation of a vibrant business is like raising a child from birth to adulthood. Like a parent has to commit to their children, you must commit to your system and your business. It is at the Redline where the limits of a car are tested, and that is where your limits will be tested.

Too many people saunter through life coasting in first gear and then wonder, how did I get here? Who doesn’t want to worry about money? Unfortunately, it doesn’t take any effort to be “interested” in wealth and financial security. Interest is kindergarten; it isn’t enough, and those who have “interest” live in first gear. To leave first gear, a string of good choices have to happen, to the point it becomes a lifestyle. No, this isn’t an overnight thing. There’s a profound difference between interest and commitment. It is defined by the quality and consistency of your actions. Interest reads a book; commitment applies the book 50 times. Interest wants to start a business; commitment files LLC paperwork. Interest works on your business an hour a day Monday through Friday; commitment works on your business seven days a week whenever time permits. Interest leases an expensive car; commitment rides a bike and puts the money into your system. Interest is looking rich; commitment is planning to be rich.

Fastlane winners are forged at the Redline.

Most people aren’t willing, and it separates the winners from the losers. The idea of living in the rat race for 50 years has to be more painful than the idea of working your ass off to escape it. You can have mediocre comfort now or meteoric comfort later. The Fastlaner trades short- term comforts with the foreknowledge that long- term extraordinary comfort is to be gained.

The brick walls are there for a reason. The brick walls are not there to keep us out; the brick walls are there to give us a chance to show how badly we want something. The brick walls are there to stop the people who don’t want it badly enough. They are there to stop the other people!

The last two words of the quote are “other people.” You want to be damn sure you aren’t “other people,” because “other people” is synonymous with “most people.” Most people are consumers who are two paychecks from broke. Most people won’t invest long hours into their business system while friends are living it up on credit. Most people will allow friends and family to deflate their dreams with “that won’t work” directives. Most people start excited and gush with exuberance but give up at the first pothole or failure. Most people succumb to “I quit” and give up not knowing that they are one or two plays away from a touchdown— the Fastlane exponential growth curve.

“Are we there yet?” Wealth is a devious entity, and its elusiveness weeds out the weak. Your journey will follow a predictable path of excitement, questioning, commitment, and rebirth. Fastlane success requires an investment toll of time and effort. This is the toll that makes you special and keeps everyone else OUT.

This Redlined effort cannot be bypassed nor outsourced. Prime your expectations for work and sacrifice, know your destination and know that you are simply paying the toll because you don’t want to trade 5- for- 2 for life! If you don’t do the hard work that Fastlane opportunity demands, someone else will. And if you aren’t like everyone, you will discover something miraculous: You can live unlike everyone.

The sweat of success is failure. While you can’t build cardiovascular endurance without sweating, you can’t experience success without failure. Failure is simply a natural response to success. If you avoid failure you will also avoid success.

You can’t drive the road to wealth with the brakes engaged. You have to take risks. Get uncomfortable and fail into progress.

What causes fear of failure? Answer: an overestimated worst- case consequence analysis. What is the worst that could happen and the probability of it happening? You have to go back to work? You or the wife needs a second job? Big deal. When you resist societal headwinds, you will sweat!

Take calculated risks. Do so and shit happens. You meet new people. New opportunities arise. Feedback pours in. “Lucky breaks” converge into your life. The act of doing does marvelous things.

“A smart man learns from his mistakes. A wise man learns from the mistakes of others.”

Fear of failure is normal, yet failure creates experience and experience breeds wisdom.

You have a challenge: If you want to hit home runs, you’ve got to get up to the plate and swing. Home runs or singles can’t be hit sitting on the bench or on the couch inhaling Cheetos while killing grunts on Halo 3. Get up to the plate and start swinging! Start striking out! Foul balls and pop outs! After enough swings and acclimating yourself to the velocity of business, contact becomes easier.

When it comes to risk analysis, there are two types of risk designated by best- and worst- case outcomes or consequences: intelligent risks and moronic risks.

When you take intelligent risks and avoid the moronic ones, you amplify your wealth trajectory through time. Intelligent risks have a limited downside, while their upside is unlimited. Moronic risks have a bottomless downside and their upside is limited, or short term.

Most moronic risks fall into the asymptomatic category. They simply aren’t clearly defined and it takes a little diligence to spot them.

If you quit your job to pursue a Fastlane business, it’s an intelligent risk. Your upside could be millions. The downside? You might have to live below your standards: mop floors, flip burgers, eat rice and beans, and ride your bike to the grocery store. Or worse, deny your child the latest iPhone. Is that really that bad? Not if you know your destination and your commitment to the roadmap. Again, it all comes down to what you are willing to do and not do. Risk involves careful stewardship of choice. Minimize moronic risk and take advantage of intelligent risk. As for failure, trust me— it is easier to live in regret of failure than in regret of never trying.

Opportunity drives through your neighborhood frequently, and when it does, you have to grab it and don’t let go. Evaluate the risk and take action. Unfortunately, opportunity doesn’t care about your timing. Opportunity doesn’t care about your circumstances, your broken- down car, or your life’s turmoil. It comes and goes of its own will, has a mind of its own, and it’s blind to predicaments. Opportunity comes dressed as changes and challenges. Remember, change makes millionaires.

Timing is rarely perfect. Waiting empowers mediocrity. People sit around waiting their entire lives for the perfect this, the perfect that. The perfect scenarios and circumstances never arrive. What does arrive? Time, old age, and the specter of a dream lost.

And now you have the opportunity to get out of the garage and take the road. The road is where your Fastlane journey starts. Fastlane roads lead to wealth. You have the Fastlane roadmap, and you know how the Slowlane and the Sidewalk operate. You know how to tune your vehicle. You know which mindsets are assets and which are liabilities. You’ve exposed the gravitational forces that will conspire against your vehicle. You have all the necessary tools to get out of the garage and get on one of the many roads to wealth. Yes, it’s time to hit the road.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions
✓- Interest is first gear. Commitment is the Redline.
✓- Hard work and commitment separates the winners from the losers.
✓- Some choose short- term mediocre comfort over long- term meteoric comfort.
✓- To live unlike everyone else, you have to do what everyone else won’t.
✓- Arm your expectations to hard work, sacrifice, and other bumps in the road. These are the land mines where the weak are removed from the road and sent back to the land of “most people.”
✓- Failure is natural to success. Expect it and learn from it.
✓- One home run could set you financially secure for your life, perhaps generations.
✓- Home runs can’t be hit in the dug out.
✓- Moronic risks have unlimited downside (long term) and limited upside (short term).
✓- Intelligent risks have unlimited upside (long term) and limited downside (short term.)
✓- There is never perfect timing and waiting for “someday” just wastes time.

## CHAPTER 29

He who chooses the beginning of the road chooses the place it leads to. It is the means that determines the end. ~ Henry Emerson Fosdick

The Law of Effection says to make millions you must impact millions. How can you impact millions? In the Slowlane you explode intrinsic value, become enormously indispensable, and earn millions. In the Fastlane, you engineer a business that touches millions of lives in scale, or many lives in magnitude. If your road doesn’t lead through Effection’s neighborhood or have an exit- ramp onto it, sorry, you’re on the wrong road.

1) The Commandment of Control 2) The Commandment of Entry 3) The Commandment of Need 4) The Commandment of Time 5) The Commandment of Scale CENTS is a Fastlane litmus test and validates your road.

A road meeting all five commandments can make you filthy rich fast. As violations accrue, the road degrades in its wealth potential, and with it, your ability to get near Effection also degrades. While it’s possible to violate one or more commandments and still create wealth quickly, you should aim for a road that satisfies all five commandments. Potent roads are potent wealth creators. Sadly, most business opportunities fail the commandments, and, if they fail, they don’t deserve your respect or attention.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions
✓- Not all businesses are the right road. Few roads move through, or near, the Law of Effection.
✓- The best roads and the purest Fastlanes satisfy the CENTS Framework; the Five Fastlane Commandments: Control, Entry, Need, Time, and Scale.

## CHAPTER 30

There is no dependence that can be sure but a dependence on one’s self. ~ John Gay

Yes or no. You’re either driving the Fastlane or you aren’t. You’re either in control over your financial plan or you aren’t. There is no in between. And if you’re not driving, you’re sitting in the passenger seat and someone else is in control.

Senseless? Not exactly. This is how many people approach business: They hitchhike, give up the driver’s seat, and violate the Commandment of Control. In doing so, they sacrifice control over their financial plan and ultimately, make someone else rich.

A business hitchhiker seeks refuge from risk and cowers within the confines of a matriarchal organization. This subservient relationship relinquishes control and leaves you vulnerable to the driver’s actions. When you control your business, you control everything in your business— your organization, your products, your pricing, your revenue model, and your operational choices. If you can’t control every aspect of your company, you’re not driving! And if you can’t drive, you set yourself up for sudden, unexpected crashes.

✓- Drivers create MLM companies; they don’t join them.
✓- Drivers sell franchises; they don’t buy them.
✓- Drivers offer affiliate programs; they don’t join them.
✓- Drivers run hedge funds; they don’t invest in them.
✓- Drivers sell stock; they don’t buy stock.
✓- Drivers offer drop- shipping; they don’t use drop- shipping.
✓- Drivers offer employment; they don’t get employed.
✓- Drivers accept rents and royalties; they don’t pay rents and royalties.
✓- Drivers sell licenses; they don’t buy them.
✓- Drivers sell IPO shares; they don’t buy them.
✓- Drivers don’t join the hottest trend, they serve the hottest trend.

The driver retains control and makes the big money. At best, the hitchhiker makes good money.

To hit big money or legendary money, you need to control every aspect of your system. When you relinquish control and defer power to a higher authority, you cede big money to the driver and accept good money as the passenger.

I can’t imagine running a company in which another entity has the power to instantaneously kill your revenue stream. If someone can “flip a switch” and destroy your business, you’re playing roulette with your financial plan. The congenital danger of hitchhiking is that you give up the keys to the driver. If the driver crashes into a wall, guess who goes with them. You.

The problem with hitchhiking is you really never know the driver. The driver could be ethical, moral, and just, or the driver could be corrupt and evil. Either way, you waive power to your driver. He who owns the keys owns the power.

If you can’t change your product, your price, or influence marketing decisions, are you the boss?

When drivers make radical turns and change terms, you have no choice but to go with them. If it’s bankruptcy or criminal neglect, their sinking ship becomes yours. Do you really want to partake in a business relationship like this?

Build corporate ladders— don’t join them. Build pyramid organizations— don’t join them. Think manufacture, not retail.

To become a shark, you have to think like one. Sharks think big and guppies think small. As a shark, you have to drill into your belief system and change your mindset.

Think globally, not locally. Think to lead, not to follow. Think to innovate, not to copy.

The change and transformation from guppy to shark starts with your thoughts as your focus moves from the few to the many. When you engage your Fastlane road, be the shark and use the entire ocean as your playground. Ever watch a school of fish? Each fish doesn’t act individually. They act as a collective. Unfortunately, most people can’t see the danger of this analogy. They’re just one fish immersed in a collective controlled by a force greater than themselves. And who is attracted to these schools of fish? The sharks. Be the shark, the predator, not the guppy. Be a driver, not a hitchhiker.

logic eludes most people.

When you blindly invest your life and time into someone else’s brand, you become a part of their marketing plan. You become a swab of paint in their big picture. You resign yourself to the slim possibility of making good money versus big money.

at the heart of entrepreneurship is creation and innovation. Hitchhikers aren’t pioneers; they don’t create or innovate. They sell, operate, and manage.

He’s not stuck in a rat race, but a rabbit race from one carrot to the next.

You must create the company people are dying to join. You must control the product and the policy. Take the producer’s role.

If you don’t control your system, your money tree, and your brand, you control nothing. You must sit atop the pyramid and serve the masses. Stop climbing pyramids and start building them.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions
✓- Hitchhikers relinquish control of their business to a Fastlaner.
✓- There is a difference between “good” money and “big” money. Hitchhikers can make good money while Fastlaners make big money. Sometimes legendary money.
✓- In a driver/ hitchhiker relationship, the driver retains control and the hitchhiker is at the driver’s mercy. Hitchhikers are subordinated to someone else’s Fastlane plan.
✓- Make the world your habitat of play in an organization you control.
✓- Network marketing has little to do with entrepreneurship but more to do with sales, networking, training, and motivation.
✓- Network marketing fails both the Commandments of Control and Entry, and sometimes, Need.
✓- Network marketers are soldiers in a Fastlaner’s army.
✓- Network marketing is a powerful distribution system. As a Fastlaner, seek to own one, not join one.
✓- Network marketing can have some excellent education value in the realm of sales, motivation, and team building.
✓- If you can succeed at network marketing, you should be able to succeed in a Fastlane venture.

## CHAPTER 31

Our plans miscarry because they have no aim. When a man does not know what harbor he is making for, no wind is the right wind. ~ Seneca

Crowded, jammed roads move slowly, if at all.

The Commandment of Entry states that as entry barriers to any business road fall, or lessen, the effectiveness of that road declines while competition in that field subsequently strengthens. Higher entry barriers equate to stronger, more powerful roads with less competition and need for exceptionality.

Low- barrier- entry businesses are weak roads because easy entry creates high competition and high traffic, all of which share the same pie. And where there is traffic, there is no movement.

The world is littered with so- called businesses that have no entry barriers. And that is why they suck and the people who follow them aren’t rich.

You can be a pyramid builder or a pyramid climber. You can be the sheep or the sheepherder.

Lack of entry itself creates the marketplace, and to succeed in that marketplace, you have to be exceptional.

There’s an old saying, “In a gold rush, don’t dig for gold, sell shovels!” When it comes to entry, your industry and your business should not be available to everyone, because if it is, you need to be exceptional. And if you are exceptional, easy entry becomes not a liability, but an asset.

Is getting into business an event or a process? Real business startups are processes, not events.

They leverage entry ease as an advantage.

As entrepreneurs, we want to start companies that others can join as an event.

Violate entry and you stamp your ticket into the world of everyone and become a screw in someone else’s Fastlane plan.

A road full of traffic is a road full of everyone. If everyone is doing it, I won’t be doing it. I’ll exit the road, and you should too. Why? Because everyone isn’t wealthy. If everyone were wealthy, “everybody is doing it” would work.

When it comes to money, the best warning flag is “everyone.” Everyone is a red flag that the Commandment of Entry has been violated. If everyone is bewitched by the same activity, it surely will fail. While “everyone” was buying houses like crazy during the housing boom, I did the opposite. I sat on the sidelines and sold. When the frenzy is buying, you should be selling. When the frenzy is selling, you should be buying or staying pat. History is littered with “everyone is doing it” booms and busts.

a heavily trafficked road that usually crawls toward impending doom, like a herd of lambs heading for slaughter..

I spotted the signs of “everyone is doing it,” because if everyone were rich, “everybody is doing it” would work. While this logic might seem spurious, it has never failed me. How do I know when “everyone is doing it?” Simple. When there is irrational exuberance about any investment that pervades to Team Consumer— the general populous— that’s when I know it is time to GET OUT AND STAY OUT.

Dumb money— EVERYONE— always shows up at the end of a boom. Who is dumb money? Consumers! Money chasers!

With every busted boom, new millionaires and billionaires are created because they saw the impending collapse inevitable in every meteoric irrational ascension.

Everyone sells and the richest man in the world buys. Hmmm. Could it be that everyone is wrong? Yes it could.

If you want to live unlike everyone, you can’t be like everyone. Don’t confuse that with exceptionality. You have to lead the pack and have “everyone” follow. When the sheep are lining up single- file for slaughter, you want to own the slaughterhouse.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions
✓- The Commandment of Entry states that as entry barriers fall, competition rises and the road weakens.
✓- Easy access roads carry more traffic. More traffic generates higher competition, and higher competition creates lower margins for the participants.
✓- Businesses with weak entry often lack control and operate in saturated marketplaces. Exceptionalism is required to overcome weak entry barriers.
✓- Access to a business road should be a process with a toll, not an event.
✓- “Everyone” consists of the general populous and is served by the mainstream media.
✓- If everyone were wealthy, “everybody is doing it” would work. And if everyone is wealthy, then no one is wealthy.
✓- “Everyone is doing it” is a signal to overbought conditions and the entrance of “dumb money.”

## CHAPTER 32

What do we live for, if not to make life less difficult for each other? ~ George Eliot

Ninety percent of all new businesses fail within five years, and I know why they fail. They fail because they fail the Commandment of Need.

When you build a business on a flawed foundation, it will fail. Sand foundations crumble houses. Businesses which violate the Commandment of Need enter the 90% failure category or masquerade as a job. The winning business premise is a simple and often forgotten concept that should be ridiculously obvious, but it isn’t.

Businesses that solve needs and provide value win. Businesses that solve problems win profits. Selfish, narcissistic motives do not make good, long- term business models.

Seriously, no one cares about your desires, your dreams, your passions, your “whys” or your reasons for wanting to be rich. No one cares that you want to own a Ferrari and prove your parents wrong. No one cares that corporate America wronged you. No one cares! Yes, the world is a selfish place and nobody gives two shits about your motives to “go Fastlane.”

People care about what your business can do for them. How will it help them? What’s in it for them? Will it solve their problem? Make their life easier? Provide them with shelter? Save them money? Educate them? Make them feel something? Tell me, why on God’s green Earth should I give your business money? What value are you adding to my life?

Consumers are selfish. They demand to know is “what’s in it for me!” To succeed as a producer, surrender your own selfishness and address the selfishness of others.

Stop thinking about business in terms of your selfish desires, whether it’s money, dreams or “do what you love.” Instead, chase needs, problems, pain points, service deficiencies, and emotions.

Entrepreneurs fail because they create businesses based on selfish premises, and selfish premises don’t yield profitable businesses; they lead directly into the 90% failure wastebasket.

You and your business attract money when you stop being selfish and turn your business’s focus from the needs of yourself to the needs of other people. Give first, take second. Needs come first, not money! Charm the marketplace with your own selfish needs and my bet is placed on your failure.

The correct foundation is externally based on market needs, not internal selfish needs.

Money chasers are consumers who haven’t quite made the transition to producer. They want to be producers, but they selfishly think like consumers.

To Attract Money Is to Forget About Money Want to make big bucks? Then start attracting money instead of chasing it.

Money is like a mischievous cat; if you chase it around the neighborhood, it eludes you. It hides up a tree, behind the rose bush, or in the garden. However, if you ignore it and focus on what attracts the cat, it comes to you and sits in your lap.

Money isn’t attracted to selfish people. It is attracted to businesses that solve problems. It’s attracted to people who fill needs and add value. Solve needs massively and money massively attracts.

The amount of money in your life is merely a reflection to the amount of value you have given to others. Ignore this symbiosis and money will ignore you. Successful businesses share one common trait: The satisfaction of consumer needs as reflected by sales in the marketplace. The marketplaces and consumers, not you, determine if your business is viable. If you sell 10 million anything, 10 million people have voted that your product will help them, or satisfy one of their needs.

The only Fastlane road that works is a road paved with cement— rock hard needs, wants, and solutions— not sand. A rock hard pavement gives you the unfair odds. Solve needs on a massive scale or in magnitude. It could be as fantastic as starting a software company as Bill Gates did, or something seemingly minute like putting a new spin on something old.

Make a freaking impact and start providing value! Let money come to you! Look around outside your world, stop being selfish, and help your fellow humans solve their problems. In a world of selfishness, become unselfish.

Need something more concrete? No problem. Make 1 million people achieve any of the following: = > Make them feel better. (entertainment, music, video games) = > Help them solve a problem. = > Educate them. = > Make them look better (health, nutrition, clothing, makeup). = > Give them security (housing, safety, health). = > Raise a positive emotion (love, happiness, laughter, self- confidence). = > Satisfy appetites, from basic (food) to the risqué (sexual). = > Make things easier. = > Enhance their dreams and give hope. . . . and I guarantee, you will be worth millions.

For “do what you love” to work, you need two things: 1) Your love must solve a need and 2) You must be exceptional at it.

“Doing what you love” for money often isn’t good enough because we aren’t good enough. Additionally, so many people are “doing what they love” that their markets get crowded and margins deflate. Heavy competition reigns.

“It is for others to say whether I am useful or not.”

It isn’t for you to decide whether you are useful. The marketplace makes that determination. People pay for their satisfaction; they don’t pay to satisfy your need of “do what you love.” People pay for solutions, not for your enjoyment. People pay for solved problems. People don’t give a rats- ass about your love for whatever. If “do what you love” doesn’t fill a need spectacularly, no one will pay for it!

When you “do what you love,” prepare to face stiff competition. Who enjoys higher margins? The personal trainer? Or the guy who starts a company to clean up crime scenes?

The second danger of derivatives is that your love becomes vulnerable to contamination when you do it for money. If you are forced to do anything, even something you purport to love, in exchange for a paycheck, that love is put in danger.

Your Ignition: Moving from Love to Passion The motivational fuel for the Fastlane is not love, but passion— passion for your future vision and passion from personal growth. If you have a passion for a specific goal, you’ll do anything for it.

Your vehicle needs an ignition, a starter, something that compels you to jump out of bed in the morning challenged to tackle the day. That ignition is passion. Other people might call this a meaning, a purpose, or a “why”. You need to want something greater for you, your family, or something else. It is different for everybody, but when you find it, you will do anything for it.

When you put your goals on a road that actually leads to a dreamy destination, it impassions daily action. If you can’t get paid doing some activity, identify a specific “why” or “end goal” that ignites your passion to act.

Passion beats “do what you love,” because passion is generalized and can be laser focused toward any goal. When the focus is “doing what you love,” the focus becomes industry- specific and you’re likely to violate the Commandment of Need. Why are you starting this business? Because you love it? Or because there is a real market need?

I repeat: Passion for an end goal, a why, drives Fastlane action.

A formidable “why” is all you need to turn your daily activities into passionate motivation—the “get up in the morning” metamorphosis to bust open a Fastlane road. What are your WHYS, and are they strong enough to motivate you into process?

The Fastlane isn’t a destination but a personal journey.

A road that doesn’t converge with your dreams is a dead end. When you concede dreams, life withers.

The problem with these people is not their jobs. We’ve all had crappy, embarrassing jobs that we hate. The problem is their dead- end road will never converge with dreams. Dreams are forsaken to pay the bills. Instead of a convergent road to dreams (or a chance of a dream), their road goes through an inescapable hell. Life becomes suffering. There is nothing wrong with working at Verizon or Taco Bell. Heck, these jobs would have been promotions compared to the meaningless jobs I’ve held. But please, don’t make these jobs your end, your final road, because the “end” most likely will never come.

You see, if your dream is dead, so is your passion. “No passion” numbs you to the greatest violinist in the world while he plays in the train depot. “No passion” leads to mediocrity and the land of everybody. “No passion” leads to unhappiness. “No passion” equals no wealth.

If you’re struggling for motivation, re- energize your dream and align it with a road capable of burning a trail to its reality. Dead dreams can’t burn trails of passion. Passion fires your will to do what is necessary beyond what others can’t. Fastlaners work unlike everyone else so they can live unlike anyone else. Take four years of hard work in exchange for 40 years of freedom. Unfortunately, most people take 40 years of hard work for four weeks of freedom, or however long their paid vacation lasts.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions
✓- The Commandment of Need states that businesses that solve needs win. Needs can be pain points, service gaps, unsolved problems, or emotional disconnects.

## CHAPTER 33

The cost of a thing is the amount of what I will call life which is required to be exchanged for it, immediately or in the long run. ~ HENRY DAVID THOREAU

The most loved (and misinterpreted) commandment is the Commandment of Time. The Commandment of Time requires that your business and its income detach from your time. Can your business work for you while you aren’t? The Commandment of Time’s objective is passive income and a vibrant money tree.

Jobs are time trades for income, and yes, so are some businesses. The goal of the Fastlane is a disconnection of your time from income, even if that income isn’t millions. Would you rather work 10 hours a week and earn $ 60,000, or work 70 hours a week for $ 140,000? I’d take the former over the latter every time.

A successful business isn’t fun and games, especially one that violates the Commandment of Time. Often people get into business with the wrong idea of what it will be like. Fueled by gurus and life coaches, many are misled, believing that “be your own boss” and “do what you love” is enough motivational fire to sprout success. Unfortunately, these would- be business owners merge onto roads that may as well trail through desert. And sorry, money trees don’t grow in the desert.

As a Fastlaner, you can start any business but eventually you must strive for automation. You want passivity and a living money tree.

When you fail the commandment of time, the failure is cause by one of two obstacles. They are: 1) The seeds are inaccessible because your business road started with a deficiency. 2) The seeds won’t grow in infertile soil.

If your business is based on a money- tree seedlings, it should be capable of growing a money tree. Content systems, computer systems, software systems, distribution systems, and human resource systems are all seedlings to money trees. If your business isn’t based on one, can one be added to make it passive?

Infertile grounds cannot grow money trees. And the failure starts when you choose a business not based upon a money tree seedling.

The problem with most business roads is that they are inhospitable for money trees simply because they fail the Commandment of Time. The seeds aren’t accessible and those seeds that are accessible, won’t take to the soil.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions
✓- A business attached to your time is a job.
✓- A business that earns income exclusive of your time satisfies the Commandment of Time.
✓- To satisfy the Commandment of Time, start with a business that uses a money- system seedling, or introduce one.

## CHAPTER 34

In business, to be a success you only have to be right once. ~ Mark Cuban

When your business road violates the Commandment of Scale, wealth acceleration is restricted. In other words, you’re given a speed limit. Drive any road with a speed limit of 15 and you aren’t going to get anywhere fast. Scale is about leverage and leverage is what gives the Fastlane wealth equation its power.

Business leverage is like a playing field, or a habitat of water. You can choose to inhabit the ocean or a pool at the local park. There are six business habitats:
✓- Local/ community (pool)
✓- County/ city (pond)
✓- Statewide (lagoon)
✓- Regional (lake)
✓- National (sea)
✓- Worldwide (ocean)

Scale is difficult to find locally or in a pool that fits only a small number of people. Sure, it can be done, but it requires magnitude, and magnitude doesn’t come cheap. If you own a tanning salon, your habitat is local. If you own an upscale restaurant, your habitat is county/ city. If you own an Internet company, your habitat is worldwide. The larger the habitat, the greater the potential speed, or leverage, of your Fastlane.

Billionaire Mark Cuban recently wrote on his blog that it doesn’t matter how many times you strike out in business because you only have to be right once, and that “once” can set you up for life. In other words, be in the business of home runs.

Business is like baseball. Play on a field where you can hit home runs; don’t play on a field where they’re prohibited!

When you violate the Commandment of Scale you disarm the Fastlane wealth equation and demote its power to Slowlane status.

Wealth = Net Profit + Asset Value Asset value is predicated on net profit, which is predicated by unit profit multiplied by units sold. Net Profit = Units Sold × Unit Profit If “units sold” has a ceiling, you stifle leverage. Without leverage, you can’t create wealth exponentially. When you travel a business road incapable of scale, you render the Fastlane wealth equation impotent.

To achieve scale, magnitude or reach must increase. Magnitude is naturally increased with price or cost.

Higher prices and cost implicitly drive magnitude. If you successfully sell the most expensive apartment building in Manhattan, you have had an effect of magnitude and realize scale. If you are operating with magnitude, you are near or at Effection.

Reach, exclusive of magnitude, also achieves scale. Reach is massive numbers. The more people you reach, the greater scale potential. Who does your business serve? The local neighborhood? Or the world? The bigger your pool of play, the bigger your potential for wealth.

The Commandment of Scale demands a business that maximizes the Fastlane wealth equation. Give the Law of Effection a chance! Give wealth a chance!

How do you know if your business (or potential business) honors the Commandment of Scale? Ask: = > Can the net income of this business scale limitlessly, say, from $ 2,000 per month to $ 200,000? = > Can the asset value of this business scale into the millions? = > Can this business impact millions? Or does it impact hundreds? Is its customer pool the world or a small community in the city? = > Can this business be replicated and expanded beyond the local trading area by franchising, chaining, or additional units? = > Best- case scenario, what is the units- sold potential? One hundred or one hundred million? = > Best- case scenario, how pliable is unit profit? Does it have magnitude?

Tiny habitats create tiny wealth. Scale is large numbers. Think big, nationally, and globally. Big numbers, or scale, is the inroad to The Law of Effection. To make millions, you must affect millions. That doesn’t happen in a small store on Main Street, but in hundreds of stores across the country.

If you can’t access the Law of Effection, you won’t get rich. The conduit to all wealth is via the Law of Effection. For the Slowlaner, the LOE has to be hit by massive intrinsic value explosion: Sing in front of millions, entertain millions, play ball in front of millions. For the Fastlaner, the LOE is leveraged by scale or asset value explosion: Sell millions, help millions, serve millions, impact millions.

Effection’s strongest barricade is scale. If you can’t serve millions, you won’t make millions.

A business that lacks scale acts like a car with a speed governor that prevents acceleration.

The other barricade to Effection is Magnitude.

While direct access to the Law of Effection is a foolproof road to wealth, indirect access isn’t so clear, since Effection always trickles up to owners and producers, not down to employees or consumers.

Effection always is biased toward the architect of the system.

If you want access to the Law of Effection, drive a road that can break through scale or magnitude while controlling its source. If you can’t be the source, serve the source.

Thankfully, you can easily determine which roads run parallel to the Law of Effection. Whatever your road, regardless of roadmap, can it directly scale to impact millions (scale)? Can it tremendously impact a few (magnitude)?

✓- If you invent a gadget that millions can use, you have direct scale and the Law is accessible. Fast wealth is a possible.
✓- If you are chosen as a finalist for American Idol, you have direct scale and the Law is accessible. Fast wealth is possible.
✓- If you build a website that serves single moms, you have direct scale and the law is accessible. Fast wealth is possible.
✓- If you are two management positions away from a CFO position at a Fortune 100 Company, you have indirect scale and the law is accessible. Fast wealth is possible.
✓- If you are an attorney and take cases that involve wrongful deaths, you have indirect magnitude and the law is accessible. Fast wealth is possible.
✓- If you create a successful retail store and franchise it to 300 entrepreneurs around the country, you have both scale and magnitude and the law is accessible. Fast wealth is possible.
✓- If you invent a machine that detects skin cancer, you have magnitude and scale and the law is accessible. Fast wealth is possible.

Think big, but think scale and/ or magnitude. Analyze your Fastlane equation and examine the variables. What are your maximum units sold and maximum profit per unit? What is the size of your customer pool?

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions
✓- Your total pool of customers determines your habitat. The larger the habitat, the greater the potential for wealth.
✓- A business can be a singles or a home- run- based business. Its strength is determined by scale, which is derived by habitat.
✓- The Fastlane wealth equation is disarmed when you violate the Commandment of Scale.
✓- Scale is achieved in reach (units sold) and/ or magnitude (unit profit).
✓- The Law of Effection is the primary conduit to wealth, which can be road- blocked by scale, magnitude, or source.
✓- Effection consequences trickle up to owners and producers. Breaking scale or magnitude indirectly in an uncontrolled entity is not a guarantee of wealth.
✓- To gain access to Effection, you have to break the barrier of scale or magnitude in an entity you control.
✓- Scale, magnitude, or source deficiencies create governors on the speed of wealth creation.

## CHAPTER 35

You can’t live a perfect day without doing something for someone who will never be able to repay you. ~ John Wooden

And businesses run like hobbies pay like hobbies.

Thou shalt not invest in a needless business. Thou shalt not trade time for money. Thou shalt not operate on a limited scale. Thou shalt not relinquish control. Thou shalt not let a business startup be an event over process.

The purest Fastlanes have the best wealth potential, and I knew it. When you grace the Law of Effection, money moves your way.

I call the most potent Fastlane roads “The Three I’s,” or “The Three Interstates,” because they possess the fastest upper speed limits and meet, or can meet, all five Fastlane commandments. The three Interstates are: 1) Internet 2) Innovation 3) Intentional Iteration Each interstate road is an umbrella for dozens of other roads. Put all three together and you have hundreds of roads available for your travel.

The most potent interstate is an Internet business. The Internet has made more millionaires in the last decade than any other medium out there.

The Internet is the best Fastlane available, because it immediately obeys the Five Fastlane Commandments, assuming a need- based premise. It naturally scales to a worldwide audience, it systematizes to automation via computer systems, it is a medium you can control (unfortunately, most don’t), and its barriers are still strong enough to prevent “everyone” from entry.

1) Subscription- based Offer users access to data, information, or software (SAAS), and charge a monthly fee.

2) Content- based Content- based models are online news magazines and blogs that disseminate information to a particular niche or industry. These services provide content for free consumption and sell advertising to parties who want to reach those eyeballs.

Succeeding at a content- based revenue model is difficult because entry barriers have significantly declined and they’re dependent on high traffic. Also, content systems heavily use affiliate programs, which is a hitchhiking structure.

3) Lead generation Lead generation services often provide a service to consumers while simultaneously aggregating a non- homogeneous industry.

Lead generation solves two needs: 1) The consumer’s desire to save time and money and 2) The business owner’s need to find new customers inexpensively.

4) Social Networks / Communities / Forums Community building is a cousin of content systems. Instead of pooling content for eyeballs, people are pulled into groups, or tribes. Facebook started off as a pool for college- aged students and evolved into a generic social network for all ages. LinkedIn hits the upwardly mobile professional. Social networks are mere aggregators of like- minded communities, from mystery novel writers to gear heads who like to rebuild engines on the weekend. Community building, however, is not limited to gigantic corporations. If you have 500,000 subscribers on your YouTube or Instagram account, you are community building.

5) Brokerage Systems Brokers bring buyers and sellers together and facilitate transactions. They are market- makers for a particular industry and earn money typically on each transaction.

6) Advertising Similar to brokerages, advertisers merge buyers and sellers together and accept advertising fees in lieu of transaction fees.

7) E- Commerce E- commerce is the act of selling goods, services, and information over the Internet.

When you look at the Internet as a Fastlane road, it is immensely powerful when examined against our Fastlane Wealth Equation. Wealth = Net Profit + Asset Value Within the units sold variable (within net income), the world becomes your upper limit when dealing on the Internet. Additionally, asset value, a component of the Fastlane wealth equation, is not only determined by net income, but by traffic metrics. Many websites are sold for billions and don’t have a penny of profit. Traffic, or visitors to a website, also has a boundless upside scale. The Fastlane variables of net profit and asset value have a virtually limitless upside.

Innovation is another broad stroke of Fastlane purity and encompasses many roads. It is the good old- fashioned way to get rich: Invent a product, service, or piece of information, manufacture it, and then distribute it.

Innovation covers any act of creation followed by distribution. Let me repeat that: Innovation involves two acts: 1) Manufacture and 2) Distribution.

What is the product of innovation? Virtually anything that solves a need or fulfills a desire.

Inventing is still recognized as the default get- rich- quick method out there, and yes, it is alive and well. However, don’t be fooled. Inventing isn’t really about inventing the vehicle, the telephone, or the goofy Segway— the core inventing activity is just taking something and improving or modifying it. Take something old and stale and make it better. Take an underexposed product, make it your own, and reintroduce it to the world. Take something unconventional and make it conventional.

Innovation is a dual challenged process: manufacture and distribution. Inventing a product that solves a need is half the battle. The other half is getting your invention into the hands of millions, which involves a variety of distribution channels: infomercial (sell via mass media), retail (sell to distributors and wholesalers), and direct marketing (sell via print media, postal mail, Internet).

A great product is worthless if it doesn’t get into the hands of people, and that requires distribution.

The challenge of any authoring Fastlane is never the book or the words themselves. Some of the greatest books in the world go unread, while the mediocre stuff sells millions. The difference lies in marketing, public relations, and just good old- fashioned business know- how.

Writing a book is not a business; selling the book is.

To leverage the Fastlane wealth equation and get near the Law of Effection, I have to strap on my commitment helmet and work, work, work…

The final Fastlane Interstate is “Intentional Iteration” (II). Iteration is: “the means or act of repeating a process, usually with the aim of approaching a desired goal or target or result.” Intentional iteration is a potent Fastlane but it offers the greatest challenge because it really doesn’t satisfy all five commandments, but four.

The process of intentional iteration is the act of satisfying the final commandment, scale. Scale is achieved either through human resource systems or repeated successes.

Iteration is a profitable, singles- based business scaled to home runs.

If you build a small store with intentional iteration in mind, your goal isn’t one store, but hundreds, perhaps thousands, through the act of chaining or franchising.

The intentional iterator goes into business to cookie- cut his system across many successes. A small store often starts out as a violation of four commandments but can quickly transfigure into a full- fledged Fastlane venture with iteration. The Fastlane franchising premise is to build a local business defined by systematic processes, then franchise the concept nationally or worldwide. The iterator’s goal is to replicate and sell a concept, a brand, and a system and remove himself from operations. While your little deli might not be particularly Fastlane it could be turned Fastlane by the process of II, through franchise or chaining replication.

Intentional iteration is the Fastlaner’s response to limited scale.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions
✓- The best Fastlanes satisfy all five Commandments: Control, Entry, Need, Time, and Scale.
✓- Assuming a need- based premise, the Internet is the fastest interstate, because it overwhelmingly satisfies all Commandments.
✓- Innovation can be any variety of open roads: authoring, inventing, or services.
✓- Inventing success needs coupling with distribution.
✓- A singles- based business is scaled to a home- run business by intentional iteration. With iteration, scale is conquered.

## CHAPTER 36

At first, people refuse to believe that a strange new thing can be done, then they begin to hope it can be done, then they see it can be done— then it is done, and all the world wonders why it was not done centuries ago. ~ Frances Hodgson Burnett

If you can’t see the opportunities that surround you, you haven’t tuned your Fastlane frequency to them. When you make a few minor mental adjustments, roads seemingly closed are suddenly opened. Many entrepreneurs misinterpret opportunity because they associate opportunity with breakthrough, legendary ideas. They seek virgin ideas, perfect and new; ones that would be unveiled to the world in grandiose events. Rarely does that happen.

Opportunity is rarely about some blockbuster breakthrough like the light bulb or the car, but as simple as an unmet need, or a need not met adequately. Opportunity is a solution to an inconvenience. Opportunity is simplification. Opportunity is a feeling. Opportunity is comfort. Opportunity is better service. Opportunity is fixing pain. Opportunity is putting weak companies out of business.

You’ve got a great idea, but someone is already doing it? So what. Do it better.

“Someone is doing it” is a monumental illusion imposing as an impassable obstacle. Someone is always already doing it. The bigger question is, can you do it better? Can you fill the need better, offer greater value, or be a better marketer?

“Competition is everywhere. Just do it and do it better.”

Competition is a staple of business. This opportunity was an open road, not a closed one.

Forget the Big Idea; Go for Better Successful businesses rarely evolve from some legendary idea. Nope, successful entrepreneurs take existing concepts and improve them. They take poorly met needs and solve them better. Skip the big idea and go for the big execution. You don’t need an idea that has never been done before. Old ideas suffice; just take it and do it better! Execute like no one has!

Poorly met needs are open roads often appearing closed. Successful businesses take existing ideas, services, and products and simply make them better, or spin them in new directions.

Open roads, needs and opportunity come prefaced with “code words” or phrases that scream “This is an opportunity!” When you catch yourself (or someone else) in these words, you’ve just uncovered a possible opportunity. Here are the most common phrases: “I hate . . .” What do you hate? Solve the hate, and there’s your open road. “I don’t like . . .” What don’t you like? Remove the dislike, and there’s your open road. “This frustrates me . . .” What is frustrating? Remove the frustration, and there’s your open road. “Why is this like this?” I don’t know, why is it? Remove the “why,” and there’s your open road. “Do I have to?” Do you? Remove the “have to.” There’s your open road. “I wish there was . . .” What do you wish? If you wish, others wish too. Make wishes come true, and there’s your open road. “I’m tired of . . .” What are you tired of? Fix someone’s tiresomeness, and there’s your open road. “This sucks . . .” What sucks? Remove or reduce suckage, and there’s your open road.

Opportunity is dressed in predictable code words that spotlight its presence.

The opportunities of open roads come in easily painted language: Discomfort, distress, inconvenience, complaints, problems, and performance gaps. You must attack these challenges and introduce solutions— offer solutions to the masses and I guarantee money will follow! Moral: Solve other people’s problems and you will solve your own money problems!

Failure CAN Crack A Road Open Unfortunately, the least- traveled Fastlane roads are paved in failure, not smooth asphalt. This means stalls are guaranteed. Everyone fails on the road to success. What separates the winners from the losers is what happens when failure arises. How are you going to react? Will your road trip end with the verdict being, “This Fastlane shit don’t work,” or will you switch roads? Or keep going?

Failures that drive you into new directions are often the most productive forces for invention.

Failure cracked the road open, and in that failure, the inventors had the fortitude to recognize it.

Yes, quitting your road and changing directions is sometimes the best choice. But be mindful of the distinction between “quitting” and “quitting your road.” Quitting is leaving your dreams for dead and putting them into the bin of impossibility. “Quitting your road” is changing course and turning down a new road.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions
✓- Opportunities are rarely about inventing breakthroughs, but about performance gaps, small inconveniences, and pain points.
✓- Competition should not impede your road. Competition is everywhere, and your objective should be to “do it better.” Fastlane success resides in execution, not in the idea.
✓- The world’s most successful entrepreneurs didn’t have a blockbuster ideas; they just took existing concepts and made them better, or exposed them to more people.
✓- Opportunity is exposed in your language and your thought processes, as well as other people’s language. Failure cracks open new roads.
✓- Quitting only happens when you give up on your dream.

## CHAPTER 37

The tragedy of life doesn’t lie in not reaching your goal. The tragedy lies in having no goal to reach. ~ Benjamin Mays

The Fastlane doesn’t care about your ends; it just wants to be the means.

The end of the Fastlane road trip is to crown your happiness with freedom. Freedom from financial encumbrances, freedom freedom from bosses, alarm clocks, two- hour commutes; freedom from bad ratios (9- to- 5, 5- for- 2, 2 weeks every 52 weeks and 8% over 40 years) and freedom to enjoy the world as your playground.

The Price of Freedom: Money Freedom has a price, and that price is money. Big dreams, from materialistic Ferraris to altruistic nonprofit foundations, cost money. You can’t travel the world by swimming in the oceans. You have to pay your way, and if you think money is evil, you’ve already lost.

money doesn’t change people; it just makes them more of what they already are.

No matter how big or small, dreams have a price, and that price is money, responsibility, accountability, and commitment. Yes, it will cost you money, but how much?

Your destination is the lifestyle you want while having the freedom to enjoy it.

There are two strategies to hit your destination. The first is a money system in which you save enough money that is large enough to support your lifestyle through monthly interest and dividends. The second is a business system that spawns passive cash flow that supports your lifestyle AND simultaneously funds your money system.

To make this happen, you need targets. Specifically, how much money will you and your family need? What is the price for the freedom and lifestyle you want? Find out with this four- step process: 1) Define the Lifestyle: What do you want? 2) Assess the Cost: How much do your dreams cost? 3) Set the Targets: Set the money system and business income targets. 4) Make It Real: Fund it and open it!

Step 1: Define the Lifestyle Define the lifestyle you want and its associated costs.

Step 2: Assess the Cost Determine the monthly cost for each, including all associated expenses; taxes, utilities, maintenance, insurance, etc. Don’t forget life overhead, such as health insurance, food, etc.

Next, determine your monthly allowance and other unknowns.

Next, determine your Net Living Cost by dividing Gross Living Cost by .60, or 60%. This will account for potential taxes.

Step 3: Set the Targets The goal of this step is to set your two targets: the business system income target and the money system target. To calculate your money system target, multiply your Net Living Cost by 12, then divide by .05, or 5%. Five percent is the minimum expected yield on a money system.

For your business system target, multiply your Gross Living Cost by 5, the required parameter to achieve a similar result by a money system.

These are your two targets. First, seek to create a business system that generates $ 70,000/ month in passive monthly income. Of this income, 40% goes to taxes, 40% goes to fund your money system, and 20% pays your lifestyle. This delivers your target lifestyle AND simultaneously funds your money system.

The other target is your passive income from a lump- sum money system. To enjoy your designated lifestyle supported by a money system, your target number is $ 5,599,920. Five percent interest on this amount is roughly $ 23,000 monthly, which covers lifestyle and taxes.

This dual- flanked attack builds a passive income stream from a business that funds a money system. The result is like warping the destination to you. You can experience retirement without being retired.

If your business system generates passive income, you can use it to fund your lifestyle and your money system simultaneously.

The key to achieving enormous tasks is to break them down into their smallest parts. You can’t run a 26- mile marathon by focusing on the 26th mile. You attack the first, then the second, third, and so forth.

the first step is to make $ 50/ month. You can’t make $ 5,000 per month until you learn how to make $ 50 per month! It’s amazing how people love to skip process and want events.

To start your money system, find a quarter and drop it into a coffee can. Congratulations, you are 25 steps closer to your goal.

Your goal isn’t 5,600,000 dollars but 560,000,000 pennies. Drop your loose change into your can at the end of each day. Find 60 cents there, 25 cents there, 115 cents there; it adds up and, albeit small, you move closer to your goal daily. Ridiculous? Nope, this is how I started, and yes, I still practice this today because this exercise has three conditioning purposes.

First, when you drop change into your bucket daily, you train yourself to visualize your goal moving closer. You get a daily reminder. Certainly you won’t accumulate 560 million pennies in this fashion, but the objective is repetitive progress toward a seemingly distant goal. Second, it forces you to evaluate: Have you applied pressure to that goal, or is your change bucket the only weapon in your arsenal? Are you pursuing a Fastlane business or still confined to a job? The third purpose is to change your relationship with money. If you are serious about a money system, you’re going to need a big shift in your beliefs about money. What is money to you? A medium to get the latest Call of Duty release? Or the soldiers for your army of freedom fighters?

The final step is to fund your money system at a brokerage firm. Designate an account that represents your money system.

pick an income fund that yields at least 5% yearly and move the funds there.

With an actual account, you can witness the real- time passivity of your money system. If you have $ 50,000 in your passive money system (not leveraged in a Fastlane pursuit) you can literally see your passive income stream every month in the form of either interest or dividends.

Fastlane wealth is created by the net income and asset value— not by the stock market or compound interest. Your Fastlane business should fund this account, not savings from your paycheck.

Managing a Money System Demands Financial Literacy You can’t build a financial empire if you’re ignorant of basic finance and economics. These disciplines are the building blocks to a financial empire, and without them the Sidewalk becomes a danger.

Remember, more money doesn’t solve money problems. If not educating yourself after graduation is one step on the Sidewalk, the other is not educating yourself on basic finance and economics.

The world is full of financial illiterates; they’ve failed driver’s education and don’t know the rules of the road. As kids, we aren’t taught money management or basic financial discipline. We’re abandoned in a financial jungle swarming with predators. Many perfectly intelligent people lack rudimentary knowledge of basic financial concepts such as:
✓- Interest rates
✓- Taxable and non- taxable yields
✓- Amortization of mortgages
✓- The balancing of a check book
✓- Basic percentage calculations
✓- Calculating return on investment
✓- Why stocks rise and fall
✓- Why a guaranteed 15% return on a bank CD is screaming, “scam!”
✓- How stock options work, such as calls and puts
✓- Why insurance exists
✓- How a mutual fund works
✓- What bonds are and how they rise and fall
✓- Global currency
✓- What happens to a stock when a dividend is paid

To successfully leverage a money system for passivity, you have to familiarize yourself with financial instruments that fuel the money system.

Financial illiterates can’t manage money systems. To succeed on your road trip, you have to know the rules of the road and pass wealth “driver’s education”— basic finance and economics.

The first rule of financial literacy: “Live below your means.” Yes, a pragmatic doctrine echoed from Slowlane dogmaticians that is an affable replacement for its mathematical equivalent of “Keep expenses under your income.”

Live below your means with the intent to expand your means.

Remember, Slowlaners seek to minimize expenses while the Fastlaner seeks to maximize income and asset values.

You can live richly and still live below your means, but for Fastlaners it’s a big challenge because we get paid first, not last. Tax bills come long after the income is earned, and “live below your means” requires above- average discipline.

Hiring a financial adviser doesn’t fix financial illiteracy. Yes, just because you had salad for lunch, doesn’t mean you can eat doughnuts for dinner.

If you hire a financial adviser, you need competency to assess his advisement.

Literacy gives you the power to evaluate your adviser’s advice.

Whatever the truth, if you can’t audit your adviser, you don’t have control. If you can’t critique good advice from bad you don’t have control.

For those who hire financial planners, literacy is insurance. Financial advisers do not solve financial illiteracy just as more money doesn’t solve poor money management.

Financial illiteracy exposes you to risk, and in the worst case scenario, fraud.

You see, when you are financially illiterate, you are deaf. And when you are deaf, you can’t hear the whistle.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions
✓- The Fastlane is the means to your end because dreams cost money.
✓- Conquer big goals by breaking them down to their smallest component.
✓- Daily saving reinforces your relationship with money; it is your passive system that buys freedom and another soldier added to your army.
✓- A money system isn’t used to grow wealth but to grow income. Growing wealth should be left to your Fastlane road.
✓- You will struggle to build a financial empire if you are financially illiterate.
✓- “Live below your means” is relevant at any income level.
✓- For the Fastlaner, “Live below your means” means to expand your means.
✓- A financial adviser doesn’t solve financial illiteracy and literacy is insurance.
✓- Financial illiteracy dilutes your control, especially when evaluating the advice of a financial adviser.

## CHAPTER 38

Ideas are nothing but neurological flatulence. ~ MJ DeMarco

The Fastlane philosophy and its mathematics are potential speed. You understand the Fastlane roadmap and its wealth equation. You’ve dumped the Sidewalk and the Slowlane. Your vehicle is primed and filled with fuel. You’re committed, not merely interested. You’re ready to undertake process, and know what you want and where you want to go. You’ve picked a road, and it’s time to hit the accelerator.

planned obsolescence. Planned obsolescence is a marketer’s expectation that whatever they’re selling you, you won’t use it. And if you don’t use it, you’re unlikely to ask for your money back.

Doing nothing is expected. Human nature plays a powerful role in the business models of producers. Get- rich systems sold on TV (or online via landing pages) take advantage of human nature because humans seek events and want to avoid process. The path of least resistance is to not do anything, or to try halfheartedly.

It’s one thing to possess the treasure map; it’s another to get out of the house and follow it. Doing nothing is normal when it’s normalcy that you seek to avoid.

Speed is not thinking about a Fastlane business, but creating it. Speed is turning off Playstation. Speed is uncovering a need and formulating a solution and a prototype. Speed is filing paperwork for your business entity. Speed is making contacts and forcing your process out into the world. Speed is approaching your business like a strategic game of chess while your opponents play checkers.

Chess is a complex game with complex maneuvers, and your business must be run similarly. Unfortunately, most business owners approach business one- dimensionally, like checkers. All the pieces move identically, while in chess, the action is multi- dimensional because each piece moves differently with different roles. The entrepreneur who tries to compete playing checkers puts them self in a winless game.

The checker- playing entrepreneur has one move in the playbook: price. Raise prices, lower prices, cut costs, cheaper suppliers: “Oh Lord, how can I be the cheapest so everyone buys from me?” This one- dimensional attack throws entrepreneurs into cyclical bidding wars, marginalizing their offers with one goal in mind: To be the cheapest.

You’ve got a system to build!

Potential speed is a loose idea that needs an executioner.

Actual speed is execution— pressure applied to an accelerator— and it’s the king of the entire game.

Execution is getting that idea out of your mind on onto the roads of possibility.

You see, ideas are nothing but a chemical reaction in your brain. It’s an event that requires little effort.

An idea is the event, the execution is the process.

Successful entrepreneurs don’t start in flashes of brilliance; no, they take that flash of an idea (the event) and transform it into massive execution (the process). Execution is the great divider separating winners and losers from their ideas.

If you want to retire 30 years early, you need a dominant, relentless king. Aloof and blasé kings lose games and don’t win races.

In the world of wealth, ideas are worthless yet treated like gold.

The owner of an idea is not he who imagines it, but he who executes it.

ideas are just multipliers while execution represents actual money. Within our Fastlane chess game, ideas (pawns) are potential speed, while execution (the king) is the pressure applied to the accelerator.

The Pawn: Idea (Potential Top Speed) Awful idea = 1 mph Weak idea = 5 mph So- so idea = 35 mph Good idea = 65 mph Great idea = 100 mph Brilliant idea = 200 mph The King: Execution (Accelerator Pressure) No execution = $ 1 Weak execution = $ 1,000 So- so execution = $ 10,000 Good execution = $ 100,000 Great execution = $ 1,000,000 Brilliant execution = $ 10,000,000

After my revenue model became successful and unmercifully copied, did my business decline and fail? No, because the idea wasn’t the linchpin to success, it was execution. Competitors who copied my idea didn’t possess a powerful king to the wealth game, and that is execution.

Chess isn’t won by stealing pawns.

Event versus process. Execution takes process: effort, sacrifice, discipline, and persistence. Ideas are just events.

The business of speed is execution. The speed of the Fastlane is growing a business exponentially and taking advantage of exploding net income and asset value.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions
✓- Speed is the transformation of ideas to execution.
✓- Most people let powerful information expire and become worthless.
✓- Successful Fastlane businesses are run multi- dimensionally, like a game of chess. One- dimensional businesses focus on price only.
✓- Execution divides winners and losers from their ideas.
✓- In business, execution is process. Ideas are events.
✓- Ideas are potential speed. Execution is actual speed.
✓- Others share your blockbuster idea. He who thinks the idea owns nothing. He who executes the idea owns everything.
✓- Real money and momentum is created when an idea (potential speed) is matched with execution (accelerator pressure).
✓- An idea is neurological flatulence. Execution makes it smell like a rose.

## CHAPTER 39

Having the world’s best idea will do you no good unless you act on it. People who want milk shouldn’t sit on a stool in the middle of the field in hopes that a cow will back up to them. ~ Curtis Grant

The world reacts how it reacts. If you think 1 + 1 = 2 and the world tells you it’s 3, you have to let it be, despite what your brain tells you. When it comes to your ideas, your plans, and your business, you NEVER know what works until you put it out to the world. In business, I call this “putting it out into the box.”

The ultimate judge- and- jury of ideas is the world and the marketplaces that serve them.

You see, the world tells you which direction you should be going at all times. Heed the signs.

How do you get the world to tell you? Put your executed ideas and concepts out into the world and let it tell you. Paint the world with your brush of genius so they can tell you how right or wrong you are. Put your executed ideas out into the box.

The world doesn’t care about ideas; it only reacts to them.

Business plans are useless because they’re ideas jacked- up on steroids.

Business plans are useless until they are married to execution.

The moment you execute, the world will tell you just what I told you: Your business plan is useless.

The market (the world) will steer your business in unimaginable places that will violate everything about your business plan. Interview any successful entrepreneur and they’ll tell you that they started off with intention A and ended at intention B. They sell product X and ultimately end selling product Y.

A blind jump into a business without knowing the specific financial constraints that govern that business would be foolhardy.

Figure out what needs figuring and just go do it. The world will do its job and tell you the directions to travel.

The best business plan in the world will always be a track record of execution.

If you are a successful entrepreneur, suddenly people will want your business plan because they know you can execute.

The value is not the plan, but the person giving it and his track record of execution.

as I built and grew my business, something miraculous happened. As my ideas crystallized into tangible assets that could be consumed by the world, suddenly I became the approachable asset.

If you want investors, get out and execute. Create a prototype. Create a brand. Create a track record that others can see or touch. Dive into process.

When you have a physical manifestation of an idea, investors will open their wallets. Heck, be good enough and they will be fighting to give you money.

Angels to private equity never invest in business plans— they invest in people with track records of execution. That is your best business plan!

So if you really want to get funding for your business, get out and make your idea tangible. Give investors something they can see, touch, and feel.

Give investors a glimpse of your execution, because that is what creates speed on the Fastlane.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions
✓- The world gives clues to the direction you should be moving.
✓- Business plans are useless because they are ideas on steroids.
✓- As soon as the world interacts with your ideas, your business plan is invalidated.
✓- The marketplace will steer you into directions that were previously unplanned for.
✓- The best business plan in the world is a track record of execution— it legitimizes the business plan.
✓- If you have a track record of execution, suddenly people will want to see your business plan.

✓- Investors are more likely to invest in something tangible and real; not ideas dissected endlessly on paper.

## CHAPTER 40

If you do build a great experience, customers tell each other about that. Word of mouth is very powerful. ~ Jeff Bezos

The Bishop in Your Chess Match When life is tough, we seek the counsel of priests, rabbis, or pastors. They are the “go- to” guys of life’s problems. Yet when it comes to your business, who is your go- to guy? Who is on the frontline with your customers? The bishop in business’s chess match is how you treat your customers— customer service. Your customer service should serve one function, similar to our men of the cloth, and that is to “always be there”: help, support, and resolve.

Nope, my black book wasn’t a treasure trove of telephone numbers from female hotties but a written record of all complaints, grievances, and issues my business experienced daily. This book has served as my guide for over a decade.

When business owners hear a complaint, most of them ignore it. Most of them pass the buck to an employee and pray the issue goes away. Not in the Fastlane.

Complaints are a beautiful thing. They represent free feedback and expose unmet needs in your business. They represent the journey’s road noise.

Complaints are the world’s whispers hinting the direction you should be moving.

There are four types of complaints: 1) Complaints of change 2) Complaints of expectation 3) Complaints of void and 4) Complaints of fraud.

Complaints of Change Take anything that people love, change it, and you’ll have a riot at the steps of your business.

The world hates change, and it’s a natural human behavior to resist change. Change endangers comfort, expectancy, and security.

The question for critique was, how much was normal? And how much was legitimate?

When you change, there will be complaints. Guaranteed. And yes, not all of them are actionable simply because human psychology is in play, not the integrity of your work.

Complaints of Expectation Complaints of expectation occur when you negatively violate customer expectations. You convince them to do business with you, they expect something, and what you provide doesn’t meet that expectation. This happens because either your service failed or their expectation was malformed by a deceptive marketing strategy. Regardless of which, both expose a problem. And it’s your problem, not the customer’s. You either need to do a better job in fulfillment or a better job in managing their expectations.

If I couldn’t manage the complaints, I could manage the expectations.

I knew if my customers were making money, they’d keep paying me.

Complaints of expectation expose operational issues, marketing misinformation, and/ or product problems.

Complaints of Void Complaints of void are when your customer continually requests something and you don’t have it.

Complaints of void are extremely valuable, as they expose unmet needs.

The complaints piled in and a pattern emerged.

Complaints of void are gold mines of opportunity. People freely tell you exactly what they want and you don’t have to pay for it! Unmet needs are served up on a silver platter.

Ask any business owner and they’ll confirm fraudulent complaints are the most disheartening because they reflect society’s worst: Illegitimate complaints designed to exploit the business owner.

Unfortunately, when you deal with millions of customers, you will encounter hundreds of Sidewalkers determined to get theirs. Yes, it can make you cynical because exploitive complainers are low- class frauds.

How do you deal with exploitive complainers? You respond once with grace, explain your position, and move on.

“I don’t know the key to success, but the key to failure is trying to please everybody.”

Complaints need to be managed with a balance, which is why I kept records. I wanted to identify patterns that would enhance the value of my service. I knew better products produced better customers, and better customers paid more.

With social media, keeping track of feedback is easier, but deciphering the noise is difficult.

Some complaints need to be ignored. If you try to make everyone happy, you’ll drive yourself nuts. Pick your battles.

Solve complaints that add the most value while helping the most. As a business owner you must remember that, while you don’t have a boss, the person who pays your rent is your customer and they always should be heard— but sometimes ignored.

Use “Sucks” to Your Advantage No need to sugarcoat it. Customer service in the modern age sucks. We have become so swamped by poor customer experiences from the world’s businesses that we now expect crappy customer service as a standard.

Customer service today has become a lost art. Our service expectation for businesses has become so pathetic that we’ve been numbed to expect nothing positive: dismissed, disinterested, or worse, disregarded.

Where customer service lacks unearths great opportunity.

You see, the beauty of expectation is that it works in reverse. While complaints of expectation are about the violation of expectations negatively, customer service that S- U- C- S is about violating expectations positively.

You can explode your business into the stratosphere by deploying a customer service strategy that exceeds expectations: I call it SUCS, or “Superior Unexpected Customer Service.”

You see, when you violate your client’s customer service expectation profile positively, you turn your customers into loyal, repeat buyers, and ultimately, disciples of your business.

Wouldn’t it be great if you could benefit from a free human resource system? You can when you create disciples for your business. Customer service that SUCS, service that violates your customer’s low- expectation profile positively, turns customers into lifelong clients. They become disciples of your business providing a never- ending stream of free advertising. Word of mouth, or social proof, is the best advertising there is. In effect, the mathematical equation behind social proof and discipleship is: 1 + 1 = 3. Because two customers creates one new one through word- of- mouth, the return on investment (ROI) on happy customers is infinite.

Your customer service strategy influences your company’s growth more than advertising itself. Satisfaction isn’t enough because it implies expectations are being met. To create raving customers, you must exceed satisfaction.

When your clients love your business, they become disciples and advertise for you. They become unpaid human resource systems, evangelists who drop your name wherever necessary.

How do you create disciples for your business? Provide customer service that SUCS— Superior Unexpected Customer Service.

I was in business to violate my customer’s expectation profile, and it paid dividends.

To provide great customer service and explode your business, determine your customers’ expectation profile. What are their expectations when they deal with your business? How do they relate to competitors and similar businesses in your industry? Make a subjective call on how your customers expect service. Then VIOLATE IT. Any time you positively violate your customer’s expectations, they buy from you again. Then they become unpaid human resource systems, liaisons, disciples, and free advertisers. All build speed. And speed builds wealth. Great customer service costs more to provide, but the benefits should outweigh the costs. If more money were spent on pleasing existing clients rather than trying to find new ones, the average business would survive longer than five years.

Unfortunately, business owners who seek money first and needs last often spend their advertising budget on new customer acquisition, customers who aren’t familiar with their uninspired and crappy customer service. It becomes a constant battle, like emptying a leaky boat with a bucket: Replace the old disgruntled customers with newer, oblivious ones.

Violate customer’s expectations. Create evangelists. Create human resource systems that will work for you, for free. Attract money.

The greatest myth of business ownership is “be your own boss.” Owners who live by that mantra eventually find themselves bosses of nothing— dead, bankrupted businesses.

Success in business comes from making your customer the boss and the No. 1 stakeholder to your business.

A stakeholder is defined as “Person, group, or organization that has direct or indirect stake in an organization because it can affect or be affected by the organization’s actions, objectives, and policies.” Long- term business suicide occurs when you are your own selfish stakeholder and forsake your customer.

Want to really know why customer service sucks? It’s because business owners place their customers at the bottom of the stakeholder chain. Public companies are the worst offenders, as shareholders come first, Wall Street second, and executives third. Guess who sits at the bottom? You and I.

“The customer pays your paycheck, not me— keep them happy.”

You see, my stakeholder wasn’t my selfish desires for fast cars and big houses. It was my customer, because I knew they had the power. My loyalty was with my customer. Yes, I had a boss, and the boss had the keys to everything I selfishly wanted.

I wanted to look big but act small.

Big companies notoriously provide poor service. Meanwhile, small companies are better apt to provide service with a personal touch. My objective was to look like I had the power of a big company, yet give personal service as if I were a one- person operation. When you receive detailed, exemplary service from a big company, you create a SUCS event and create loyal, evangelical customers.

Anywhere customer service is expected to suck, you have a business opportunity. Looking big and acting small is a setup for SUCS events. The customer expects mediocre service from the start. This tactic works well for any company that operates without a physical presence.

The trap that snares many business owners is the extreme opposite: They look small and act big.

If you insist on working 4 hours a week, your business won’t grow because your selfishness is more important than growing a business meteorically. Look small and act big and you dig your own potholes.

If an entrepreneur thinks they can’t compete because you’re too big and too well- funded, you’ve won before they’ve even started. They either commit halfheartedly or defer to another industry with duller competition. Look big, but act small.

## CHAPTER 41

People are definitely a company’s greatest asset. It doesn’t make any difference whether the product is cars or cosmetics. A company is only as good as the people it keeps. ~ Mary Kay Ash

Your castle is your business. If you put crooks in the castle, expect trouble.

A business partner is like being married. It either works fabulously or it ends in fiery divorce.

Partnerships are marriages. After the love affair and the lust wears off, they must survive on character, synergy, and complementary attributes. My early entrepreneurial ventures were all partnerships, and all miserable failures. Not that my partners were bad people, but our work ethics, values, and visions were not compatible.

Many other personality characteristics will make or break a partnership.
✓- Do you have the same work ethic? Will your partner skate while you burn the midnight oil?
✓- Do you have the same vision? Or will they compete with each other?
✓- Do you want to grow slowly while your partner wants to own the world and do it fast?
✓- Do you want to sell franchises while your partner just wants one unit that pays the bills?
✓- Do you trust this person with your life?
✓- Do you have the same personality type?
✓- Do you have the same risk tolerance?

The fact is people get into partnerships for the wrong reasons. Like people start businesses under false premises (not need- oriented), they partner under a false premise: Diversification. The partners don’t seek synergy; they seek diversification of risk, expense, and workload. Often, each partner looks to the other for the burden to bear, and when one bears more, resentment builds.

If I didn’t have good team of A’s— accountants and attorneys— I’d be poorer. And yes, these people aren’t easy to find because they’re like partners under contract, another group of individuals who have the keys to your castle.

Be very careful with whom you trust with the keys to your castle because they can drive you to financial ruin.

Investigate and interview. Get referrals from successful, established entrepreneurs. Treat your two A’s like you would any partner, because they have unfettered access to your castle, and those with the keys have the potential to steer you wrong.

When you blindly trust others to anything— business, financial investments, security— you’re vulnerable to being conned.

You must make your trust an asset to be earned by others. Let actions speak louder than words. When you allow words to disarm your trust or BS meter, you become vulnerable to attack.

Former president Ronald Reagan once said, “Trust, but verify.”

We are a trusting people and we want to believe the best. We want to believe in fairy tales and happily ever after. We want to believe we can make millions on Facebook ads, just as long as we PayPal that guru $ 97.

When you trust everyone, you chase business opportunities that violate the Commandment of Control. Others get to dictate your financial road trip. And when that happens, you crash and burn. There is only one person you can blindly trust in this world, and that is YOU.

Why so cynical? If you don’t understand now, you will later. When you serve millions, you come in contact with millions. Only then will you understand the truth of the consumer/ producer equation. Your eyes will be opened to how many people will go the extra mile to try to screw you. There is no place safe from liars, con artists, and crooks. These people commiserate in the least likely of places: your community church, that harmonic dating website, and at your posh country club.

Today I trust no one but give everyone the opportunity to prove trust. There are a lot of good people in this world, and they do outnumber the bad by a wide margin. It just takes a mild effort to find them and keep them in your life. Just be careful who you pick up on the side of the road. Don’t be tempted by a cold brew, but be blinded to the chainsaw.

To make customers disciples of your business, employees must share your customer service philosophy. You can’t let any employee ruin a multimillion dollar investment. All the intangibles in the world can’t change a poor customer service experience.

1) A SUCS customer service philosophy must be delivered by your employees. 2) Spectacular product features can’t overcome poor service.

First, employees must deliver your customer service philosophy. Your people are ambassadors of your business and they communicate your vision. Essentially, they’re business chauffeurs, and if they’re reckless, your vision is destroyed.

Your employees drive the public’s perception of your company.

You can’t be driving the ship all day. Your employees carry the water buckets, and if they aren’t ordained in service, they hijack satisfaction and create liabilities. A customer centered policy is irrelevant if employees don’t translate that policy into frontline action.

The second lesson is this: No amount of spectacular product features, such as great technology (snazzy websites) or great architecture (lavishly appointed hotels) can compensate for poor customer service.

Fanatical customer service— service that SUCS— can help compensate for shortcomings, but fanatical features cannot compensate for poor customer service, or poor human interaction.

Nothing overcomes poor human experiences!

You could own the best hotel located on the best beach, but if customers are treated like inconveniences and requests go unanswered, they won’t return.

Exponential business growth is fueled by fanatical customer service, and your frontline employees must share your vision. It doesn’t come from boastful mission statements plastered on the CEO’s office wall.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions
✓- A business partnership is as important as a marriage.
✓- A good accountant and attorney will save you thousands, perhaps millions.
✓- Accountants and attorneys have the keys to your castle; make sure you trust them fully because they have the power to right or wrong you.
✓- Unmitigated trust exposes you to unmitigated risk.
✓- Unverified trust can lead to uncontrollable consequences.
✓- Your employees communicate the public’s perception of your company.
✓- Fanatical customer service can overcome shortcomings, but fanatical features can’t overcome poor customer service.
✓- Customer service philosophy is delivered from human interactions— not ambitious mission statements on a wall plaque in the CEO’s office.

## CHAPTER 42

A market is never saturated with a good product, but it is very quickly saturated with a bad one. ~ Henry Ford

Is your product or service someone’s knight in shining armor? Is it going to save the day? Or is your knight cut from selfishness, fueled by your hopes that it will gallop in on a black stallion and make you rich while simultaneously allowing you to be your own boss?

Businesses founded on false premises will rocket to the bin of commoditization and force you to do the inevitable: To play checkers.

Commoditization is a product or service that appears homogeneous among providers. For example, a heavily commoditized service is air travel. Most people aren’t loyal to any airline; they’re loyal to the best price. The product becomes commoditized.

If your product isn’t unique, it doesn’t stand a chance and you’re forced into the strategy of “cutting prices to stand out from the crowd.”

When supply exceeds demand, prices must drop; suddenly, the product becomes commoditized.

Disregarding market needs leads to commoditization where your soul is sold to the buyer who wants the cheapest price. Where does this insanity start? People start businesses they have no business starting. People start businesses “doing what they love” or “doing what they know.”

When hundreds of people get into a business solely because they know how or want to (not need based), you get put into commoditization position: price wars haggling over a few dollars. There is limited need (limited demand) and too many providers (supply).

The point of having a need- based premise is to avoid the industry entirely, or to get in it to solve a specific problems and skew value, not to change it after the fact. If your product isn’t someone’s knight, standing out from the crowd and skewing value, it stands to be commoditized.

most business owners paid more attention to their competition than to their own business. Instead of minding their own business, they had their noses into everything that everyone else was doing. This means you neglect your own product and become reactive instead of proactive.

If your eyes are glued to the competition’s butt, guess what? Your eyes aren’t on the road ahead. If you’re following, you aren’t leading, and if you aren’t leading, you’re not innovating.

If your preoccupation is with every single thing your competition does, you’re cheating your business and your customers.

Forget about your competition 95% of the time. The other 5% should be used to exploit their weaknesses and differentiate your business. If you forget about your competition, you’re forced to focus on your business, which is to innovate, skew value, and win over the minds of your customers. And when you fill needs and your army of customers grows, something suddenly happens: Everyone follows you.

On the rare occasions you peek in at your competition, do so for exploitation. Mine their weaknesses and add value where they aren’t.

For mature companies, competition can exploit what you shouldn’t be doing, versus what you should be doing.

If you are going to take your eye off the road and spy your competitors, do so for finding value opportunities. Exploited weaknesses are where brands are born. What are they doing wrong? Where’s the inefficiency? Within the gray area of unsatisfied customers lies the opportunity to improve value and ramp up differentiation.

Differentiation is a defense to commoditization. Gloating over your competition should serve only one purpose: To find weaknesses and then be better at that weakness within your own operation. To the customer, this difference will be interpreted as better value. And better value equals more buyers won.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions
✓- Commoditization occurs when you get into business based on a false premise—“ I want to own a business” or “I know how to do this, so I’ll start a business doing it.”
✓- If you are too busy copying or watching your competition, you’re not innovating.
✓- Use your competition to exploit their weaknesses, differentiate, and skew value.

## CHAPTER 43

> Everyone has an invisible sign hanging from their neck saying, ‘Make me feel important.’ Never forget that message when working with people.
> 
> ~ Mary Kay Ash

In chess, lose your queen you lose the game. In business, most entrepreneurs play the game without their captured queen.

If you have an OK product (a weak knight), poor customer service (drunk bishops), and incompetent people (a castle full of idiots), you can survive with a powerful queen.

The queen is the most powerful piece in chess and it is also in business. Marketing can convince people to buy mediocre products. Marketing can hide or disguise service flaws. It can shadow incompetence, and it can keep convicted felons disparate from their product. The power of marketing is that an effective ad campaign can move products, regardless of the cockroaches hiding underneath. Marketing is a game of perceptions, and whatever the perception is, that’s the reality.

Businesses survive. Brands thrive. A brand is the best defense to commoditization. When your business just pays the bills for the month, you’re playing checkers and being one- dimensional. People are loyal to brands and relationships, not corporations or businesses.

If our friend wants to excel in an industry saturated with me- toos, he’s going to have to brand and differentiate himself. He needs to be a Lamborghini in a traffic jam of Chevys.

The first step at building a brand is to have a Unique Selling Proposition or a USP. As a business without one, you’re adrift in a sea of me- too businesses without a rudder, unmoored to the tradewinds of the marketplace. USP- less businesses offer nothing distinct or unique, no benefit or logical reasons why someone should buy other than hope or circumstance wrapped around a cheap price.

Your USP is your brand anchor and is typically your lead value skew. What makes your company different from the rest? What will compel a customer to buy from you over someone else?

USPs are the building blocks to brands and can compensate for higher prices or even an inferior product.

Step 1: Uncover the Benefit( s) Get into business for the right reason: to add or create value, solve problems or fill a need. That creates your first USP. If you are already in business, find your greatest product benefit, one that sets it apart from the competition. If you don’t have a distinct benefit that’s obvious to your potential buyer, you’re operating without a USP.

Step 2: Be Unique The objective of a USP is to be unique when compared to the alternatives. This plants a logical argument into your customer for choosing your company, because, without your company, they are forgoing the benefit.

USPs should use powerful action verbs that create desire and urgency. “Lose weight” should be changed to “Obliterate fat” or “Shred pounds.” “Grow your business” should be dropped in favor of “Explode revenues” or “Shatter sales records.”

Step 3: Be Specific and Give Evidence Noise is everywhere, and if you are going to rise above it, you have to alleviate natural consumer skepticism. Do so by being specific, and if possible, offer evidence.

Step 4: Keep it Short, Clear, and Concise The best USPs are short, clear, and powerful. Long phrases get skipped over.

Step 5: Integrate Your USP into ALL Marketing Materials A USP is worthless if it isn’t conveyed throughout every aspect of your business. Include your USP on all your public communications: = > Your trucks, vehicles, and buildings = > Your advertising, promotional materials, and social media accounts = > Business cards, letterheads, signs, brochures, and flyers = > Your website and your email signature = > Your voice mail system, receptionist/ sales scripts, etc.

Step 6: Make It Real A USP has to be convincing, enough so that people buy or, even better, switch brands. If it doesn’t capture your audience’s attention, or the benefit/ hook is too weak, it won’t work. And then make your USP real. You must deliver on what you say.

Face it. We seek to be different. Unique. The average teenager strives for uniqueness, which is why we have nipple rings, eye piercings, Goth, and tattoos— all expressions of “I’m different!” Successful companies take the same approach with their branding and marketing.

You see, we all are marketers and some of us are marketers of an illusion. What this does is creates an abundance of noise and makes it harder for the real value- providers to be heard. Your marketing efforts must rise above the noise.

How to Rise above the Noise There are five ways to get your message above the noise: 1) Polarize 2) Arouse emotions 3) Be risqué 4) Encourage interaction and 5) Be unconventional

Polarize Polarization probably isn’t the best business strategy for a mass- market brand, because polarization involves extreme viewpoints or messages. You don’t want to piss off half your customer base! However, polarization works fabulously for websites in need of traffic or books in need of readers.

Polarization works because it involves an extreme viewpoint, which forces people to either love or hate you.

Be Risqué Sex sells, and it is the most used get- above- the- noise technique. Sex is a powerful noise disruptor because sex never goes out of style. You can overuse it, but people will always respond to it.

But be careful: leveraging sex as an attention grabber can also tarnish your brand if it isn’t tasteful or within a reasonable spectrum of cultural sensitivity. “Great message” and “tacky” is in the eye of the beholder.

Arouse Emotion Most consumer buying decisions are driven by emotions. You and I buy stuff because we want to feel something. I don’t buy a Lamborghini to go from point A to point B; that’s practicality. I buy to feel something— pride, achievement, uniqueness, adrenaline, and fame.

If you can move your audience’s emotions and make them care, they will buy. Exhilarate people, make them cry and make them laugh. Your message will rise from the ashes of noise and compel buyers.

Be Interactive It’s one thing to watch, it’s another to do it. They say if you want to boil your passions, test drive the car of your dreams. Interactivity increases response for anything. If you can taste it, feel it, or use it, you will be more likely to buy it.

When your potential customers break down their personal barriers and expose pieces of themselves, a relationship builds making it easier to sell. A relationship sells more than an anonymous corporate entity.

Be Unconventional Convention breeds familiarity. If you’ve seen it three dozen times in the last month, do you think it will work?

On the internet, mocking convention works fabulously when combined with political incorrectness and humor.

The viral videos where shared millions of times, creating a swath of media attention and more importantly, customers.

If you get someone’s attention, half the battle is won. The other half is letting selfishness take over your audience and tailor your messages to self- interest. In other words, the good old “What’s in it for me?” How about saving 15% or more on your car insurance?

It’s ironic: To succeed a Fastlane we must forsake selfishness yet satisfy the selfishness of others.

The first human behavior you can count on is selfishness. People want what they want. People don’t care about you, your business, your product or your dreams; they want to help themselves and their family. It’s human nature. Therefore, our marketing messages must focus on benefits, not features.

People need to be told exactly what’s in it for them. How will your product or service help them? What’s the benefit? In marketing speak, it’s called the “What’s In It For Me?” (WIIFM) principle.

I noticed that small- business owners fall into their own selfish trap and love singing the praises of their company. They sell features, not realizing that people rent convenience and events, not limousines.

As consumers, we buy things to solve needs. We participate in transactions to fill voids. You don’t buy a drill; you buy a hole. You don’t buy a dress; you buy an image. You don’t buy a Toyota; you buy reliability. You don’t buy a vacation; you buy an experience.

We must become problem solvers and align our business as a savior to someone. Features must be translated into benefits. Does the fact you are the largest limousine company in Colorado solve my problem? It doesn’t until you translate that feature into a benefit.

Translating Features into Benefits If you want to sell anything, translate features to benefits. A four- step process accomplishes this. 1) Switch places. 2) Identify features. 3) Identify advantages. 4) Translate advantages into benefits.

First, trade places with your typical buyer. Be them. Who are they? What is their modus operandi?

If you can’t identify your typical buyer, your results will be flawed and your benefit hidden. Once you identify your buyer, ask: What do they want? What do they fear? What problem do they need solved? Or do they just want to “feel” something?

After you switch places with your customer and grasp what they want, your next step is to isolate the product features.

While these features were great, it was my responsibility to translate them to benefits. What makes them so great? What advantages do they offer my client?

After you isolate the features, translate those features into benefits, or a specific result.

I didn’t let them fill in the blanks; I filled in the blanks for them.

Using Price as a Branding Weapon Price is like a paint job for your product or service.

Price Conveys More than Just Cost Price is a brand- builder because price implies value. The more expensive your price, the higher its perceived value. The cheaper your price, well, the cheaper it will be perceived. Price isn’t just a number that tells someone cost. It conveys value and worth.

Unless price is your brand (Wal- Mart, Southwest Airlines), don’t let price steal your brand when it should be defining it. Price is more than just a competitive metric that slides up and down to sell goods faster. It also indirectly conveys the value of your product or service.

The right pricing strategy is crucial to brand building and marketing. The wrong price conveys the wrong meaning.

Branding and marketing. Price is part of the brand build.

Premium pricing is one of the many ways to get into the consumer’s head. But only if you can convince them of value beyond the cost of its practicality. What makes you different from the rest? Why should someone pay you more? As a marketer you have to drill into your buyer’s mind and get your brand differentiated.

Own the consumer’s mind and you own the consumer.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions
✓- Marketing and branding (the queen) is the most powerful Fastlane tool.
✓- Businesses survive. Brands thrive.
✓- Businesses have identity crises, brands don’t. Identity crises force business owners into price commoditization.
✓- Unique Selling Propositions (USPs) is a brand key and differentiates your company from the rest.
✓- People have a natural desire to be unique and different.
✓- Marketing success requires messages to break above the noise, or advertising clutter.
✓- Polarization is a great above- the- noise tool if your product targets a polarized audience— usually politics, minority opinions, and even sports teams.
✓- Sex sells and always draws eyeballs. (But can tarnish your brand image.)
✓- Consumers make buying decisions based on emotions before practicality.
✓- If you can arouse audience emotions, convincing customers to buy is easier.
✓- People like talking about themselves. If you can incorporate interaction or “try before you buy” into your campaigns, you will have better success.
✓- To be unconventional means to first isolate and identify what is conventional, then doing the opposite, or interrupting that convention.
✓- Consumers are selfishly motivated. Always target your messages toward the predisposition of “What’s in it for me?”
✓- Features are translated to benefits when you switch positions from producer to consumer, identify the feature’s advantages, and extrapolate those advantages into a specific result.
✓- Price implicitly conveys value and worth.
✓- Don’t allow your own perception of price lead your brand to mediocrity.

## CHAPTER 44

> No horse gets anywhere until he is harnessed. No steam or gas ever drives anything until it is confined. No Niagara is ever turned into light and power until it is tunneled. No life ever grows great until it is focused, dedicated, disciplined.

When you invest your time into five different businesses, you become a polygamist- opportunist.

A scattered focus leads to scattered results.

Ten businesses earning $ 10,000 cumulatively are not better than one business that does it single- handedly.

When you segregate your effort among assets, you build weak assets. Weak assets don’t do heavy lifting, and they don’t build strong pyramids. Weak assets do not generate speed. Weak assets do not scale to multimillion- dollar valuations. Weak assets do not accelerate wealth; they build income to pay the month’s bills only to start again next month.

I don’t know any highly successful polygamist- opportunists unless they were monogamous first.

To hit the top of your game, business or otherwise, you have to eat, live, and shit your thing. If you’re dabbling in 10 different things, your results will be dabbling and unimpressive. Focus on one thing and do it in the most excellent way.

Some of the greatest tech entrepreneurs built impressive companies by 100% committed focus, not diverted attentions into other ventures. After successful entrepreneurs hit the mother lode of wealth, then, and only then, do they divert into other ventures that deviate from their core business. In other words, their monogamy led to polygamy.

Money buys systems, like human resource systems, and money systems that buy time.

Fastlane success comes from monogamy; not split attentions among wives and mistresses. It’s marriage. Yes, good old- fashioned monogamy. Focus on one Fastlane business and kick ass at it.

## CHAPTER 45

> Your choices are made in a moment, but their consequences will transcend a lifetime.
> 
> ~ MJ DEMarco

1. Formula (Fastlane supercharger) Wealth is a Formula and a systematic process of beliefs, choices, actions, and habits that form a lifestyle. Wealth is a process, not an event.

2. Admit (fAstlane supercharger) Admit that the preordained path to wealth, “Get Rich Slow,” is fundamentally flawed because of Uncontrollable Limited Leverage, weak mathematics predicated on time (Wealth = Job + Markets). Admit that “Get Rich Quick” exists. Admit that “no plan” is not a good plan. Admit that luck is the residue of engagement.

3. Stop and Swap (faStlane supercharger) Stop following the wrong roadmaps. Stop doing what you’ve been doing. Stop selling your soul for a weekend. Stop thinking that 401( K) s and indexed- funds will make you rich. Swap ineffective roadmaps for the Fastlane roadmap. Swap your allegiances from consumer to producer.

4. Time (fasTlane supercharger) Time is the king asset of the Fastlane— specifically, free time. Invest in activities that pay more than money, they pay free time. Avoid time thieves, such as parasitic debt that converts free time into indentured time. Invest time into a business system that can transform indentured time into free time. Make decisions with time as a key decision factor.

5. Leverage (fastLane supercharger) Leverage controllable and unlimited mathematics to create wealth. There is no leverage within the Slowlane wealth equation, an equation predicated on time (hourly pay, annual salary, annualized return, years invested). If you can’t control the mathematics that underscore your wealth, nor accelerate them into large numbers, you can’t control your financial plan. Leverage is harnessed by a system that does the work for you.

6. Assets and Income (fastlAne supercharger) Wealth is accelerated by exploding income and Asset value via a business that can be systemized and eventually sold in a liquidation event. Live below your means but seek to expand your means by focusing on income while simultaneously controlling expenses. Exponential growth of income and asset value, not slashing expenses, creates millionaires.

7. Number (fastlaNe supercharger) What’s your Number? How much money will you need to live your dream lifestyle? Determine your number, break it down by the penny, and make it real today. Start saving your loose change, open a brokerage account, and put a chart on your wall that continually monitors your number’s progress. Make your dream lifestyle real by posting photos of that life at your workspace. For example, if you want a cabin on a mountain creek, find a picture of that vision and put it on computer so you have to see it every day. Make your future visions real and force them into your psyche so you’re constantly reminded. Make those dreams tangible and inescapable!

8. Effection (fastlanE supercharger) Grace Effection and you shall be graced with wealth. The Law of Effection states, “The more people whose lives you affect in an environment you control, the more money you will make.” Impact millions and you will make millions. When you solve needs on a massive scale, money flows into your life. Money reflects value.

9. Steer (fastlane Supercharger) Life’s Steering is choice. At some point, you must commit to the Fastlane ideology, and that commitment forms your process. Wealth is not one choice (event), just like you cannot choose to lose 100 pounds and suddenly wake up 100 pounds lighter. How you steer determines whether the Fastlane is a lifestyle, a hobby, or a lottery ticket. To enforce good decisions at the extremes, deploy WCCA and WADM. Decision horsepower is strongest in youth and bleeds with age. Examine your past choices. Why are you where you are? What has been treasonous to your life? Why are you drowning in debt? If you don’t rectify the mistakes of your past choices you will be destined to repeat them. Behavior change begins with a reflection of your past decisions and modifying them for the Fastlane mindset. Become responsible, followed by accountable.

10. Uncouple (fastlane sUpercharger) Officially Uncouple from the Slowlane wealth equation by creating your business structure in a favorable Fastlane entity: a C- or S- Corporation, or an LLC. Thereafter, your entity is the body of your surrogate business system. It “pays itself first” and the government last. It survives time separate from your time. It is your first step at creating an asset.

11. Passion & Purpose (fastlane suPercharger) With a business entity and a dollar figure that outlines your dream life, you will need a Passion and a Purpose to fuel you into habitual action. Don’t confuse “passion” with “do what you love.” Passion burns your soul and drives you to do whatever it takes. Passion revs you with excitement and enrages you with discontent. Some passions are selfish (I want a Lamborghini) and other passions are selfless (I want to help orphaned children). It doesn’t matter what it is, as long as the passion burns hot enough to burn a hole in your pants and gets you stoked for process.

12. Educate (fastlane supErcharger) Education begins at graduation. Pledge to never stop learning. What you know now is not enough to become the person you need to be tomorrow. Seek Fastlane knowledge that fosters the construction and operation of business systems in an environment that you control. Get to the library and get on the Internet. Information is the oil on your financial journey. Ensure daily reading in short bursts by leveraging existing time blocks often squandered: the train, the plane, while exercising, on lunch break, an hour in the morning before work, or while waiting at the post office.

13. Road (fastlane supeRcharger) Get onto a Fastlane Road. But don’t worry if you can’t decide which road; the road can pick you. Train your mind to see needs, problems, and ways to improve things. Observe your thoughts and language, because they expose unmet needs, or needs met poorly. You don’t have to find the next breakthrough; just find an improvement opportunity, a pain- point, or a service gap, and solve it. Many of the best businesses in the world are based on products that already existed; the owners solved the problem better or more efficiently. When you focus on market gaps, roads open. Yes, the road chooses you.

14. Control (fastlane superCharger) Control your financial plan as this refers to the Commandment of Control. Engage in an organization that you fully control, from pricing to marketing to operations. Fastlane entrepreneurs don’t cede control over critical business functions to hierarchical control structures, because they are the control structure. Swim as a shark, not a guppy.

15. Have (fastlane supercHarger) HAVE what others NEED and money will flow into your life. This reflects the Commandment of Need. You can’t explode your income by chasing money. Stop chasing money, because it eludes those who try. Instead, focus on what attracts money, and that is a business that solves needs. Money comes from providing value. Cast aside selfishness and seek to HAVE what your fellow man WANTS. When you do, money flows into your life because money is attracted to those who have what others want, desire, crave, or need.

16. Automate (fastlane superchArger) Automate your business and honor the Commandment of Time. Get your time detached from your business. The best passive- income money- tree seedlings are money systems, rental systems, computer systems, content systems, distribution systems, and human resource systems. The key to automation in any business lies in these seedlings.

17. Replicate (fastlane superchaRger) Replicate your system and honor the Commandment of Scale. Get on a playing field where home runs can be hit. To make millions, you must impact millions. To impact millions, you must be on a field capable of affecting millions! Can your product, service, process be replicated on a global scale to tap the Law of Effection?

18. Grow (fastlane supercharGer) Grow your business by treating it multi- dimensionally, like a game of chess. Build a brand, not a business. Treat customers like your boss and reposition complaints to opportunities. Listen to the world as they offer the best directional clues. Resist commoditization. Differentiate yourself from the competition. Get above the noise. Focus on one business and one business only.

19. Exit (fastlane superchargEr) Have an Exit strategy. Full passivity accomplished by a money system is one Fastlane destination. Money systems are best funded by liquidation events of massive asset values. Know when it’s time to liquidate your assets, transforming paper money into real money. Know when it’s time to get off the horse and learn to ride a new one.

20. Retire, Reward, or Repeat (fastlane superchargeR) After liquidating your asset( s), Retire or Repeat. Regardless of which, Reward yourself for milestones met along the journey. Sell your first product? Celebrate! Go to dinner, buy a cigar, drink a beer. Break $ 100,000 in net worth? Treat yourself to something nice. Book a joint- venture deal? Celebrate with an indulgence. Go over $ 1 million? Take a nice vacation. Break $ 10 million? Buy a Lamborghini.

The Fastlane isn’t a destination. It isn’t something you try, it’s something you live. It’s a mindset and it all starts in your head.

It doesn’t matter where you start, but how you proceed. The garage door to an exceptional life is open— leave behind the past that keeps you grounded and take the road. All Fastlaners start in similar straits of life turbulence.
