title: Human Adults Have Physical Responses To Cuteness
---

More than that, studies suggest that **cute images stimulate the same pleasure centers of the brain aroused by sex, a good meal or psychoactive drugs like cocaine.**

When shown cute photos, two parts of the brain are activated:

- **Nucleus Accumbens:** the pleasure centre that releases dopamine, the same chemical your brain releases on drugs
- **Orbitofrontal Cortex:** the area responsible for decision making.

to keep this instinctive protection, humans have evolved to stay childlike for as long as possible, this is called neoteny

Most animals without neoteny are self-sufficient after birth

fish, reptiles and insects aren't considered "cute"

if you have a bad day, watch some cute animal videos for a quick dopamine pick-me-up
