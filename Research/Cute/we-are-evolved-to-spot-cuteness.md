title: We Are Evolved To Spot Cuteness
---

*Babies did not evolve to be cute,* [[Babies Have A Unique Growth Pattern]]. They have a [[Biological Function Of Cuteness]]. They became appealing to a potential caretaker's eye only because infants wouldn't survive otherwise.

Babies need attentive care from adults to survive, and we have evolved into allowing baby features to trigger us to think that we need to care for them:

Human babies have unusually **large heads** because humans have unusually large brains. Their heads are round because their brains continue to grow throughout the first months of life, and the plates of the skull stay flexible and unfused to accommodate the development. Baby eyes and ears are situated comparatively far down the face and skull, and only later migrate upward in proportion to the development of bones in the cheek and jaw areas.

**Baby eyes** are also notably forward-facing, the binocular vision a likely legacy of our tree-dwelling ancestry, and all our favorite Disney characters also sport forward-facing eyes, including the ducks and mice, species that in reality have eyes on the sides of their heads.

**Infants have soft and undeveloped cartilage tissue in their noses**, which is why most babies have button noses. **Baby skin sits relatively loose on the body,** rather than being taut, the better to stretch for growth spurts to come, said Paul H. Morris, an evolutionary scientist at the University of Portsmouth in England; that lax packaging accentuates the overall roundness of form.

**Baby movements are notably clumsy**, an amusing combination of jerky and delayed, because learning to coordinate the body's many bilateral sets of large and fine muscle groups requires years of practice. On starting to walk, toddlers struggle continuously to balance themselves between left foot and right, and so the toddler gait consists as much of lateral movement as of any forward momentum.

**These "cute" features indicate extreme youth, vulnerability, harmlessness and need to adults, scientists say, and adults attending to babies closely because they have the need to makes good Darwinian sense.** As a species whose youngest members are so pathetically helpless they can't lift their heads to suckle without adult supervision, human beings must be wired to respond quickly and gamely to any and all signs of infantile desire.

To be more specific, [[Human Adults Have Physical Responses To Cuteness]].
