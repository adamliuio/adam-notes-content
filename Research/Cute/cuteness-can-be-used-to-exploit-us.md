title: Cuteness Can Be Used To Exploit Us
---

Denis Dutton, a philosopher of art at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, **the rapidity and promiscuity of the cute response makes the impulse suspect**, readily overridden by the angry sense that one is being exploited or deceived.

**"Cute cuts through all layers of meaning and says, Let's not worry about complexities, just love me,"** said Dr. Dutton, who is writing a book about Darwinian aesthetics. "That's where the sense of cheapness can come from, and the feeling of being manipulated or taken for a sucker that leads many to reject cuteness as low or shallow."

**Quick and cheap make cute appealing to those who want to catch the eye and please the crowd.** Advertisers and product designers are forever toying with cute cues to lend their merchandise instant appeal, mixing and monkeying with the vocabulary of cute to keep the message fresh and fetching.

That market-driven exercise in cultural evolution can yield bizarre if endearing results, like the blatantly ugly *Cabbage Patch dolls*, or *Furbies*, as well as [[The Volkswagen Beetle's Cute History]].
