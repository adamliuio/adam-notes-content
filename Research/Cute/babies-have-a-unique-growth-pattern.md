title: Babies Have A Unique Growth Pattern
---

Physical anthropologist Barry Bogin said that the pattern of children's growth may intentionally increase the duration of their cuteness. Bogin said that **the human brain reaches adult size when the body is only 40% complete, when "dental maturation is only 58% complete" and when "reproductive maturation is only 10% complete".** Bogin said that this allometry of human growth allows children to have a "superficially infantile" appearance (large skull, small face, small body and sexual underdevelopment) longer than in other "mammalian species". Bogin said that this cute appearance causes a "nurturing" and "care-giving" response in "older individuals".
