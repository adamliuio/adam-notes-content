title: The Volkswagen Beetle's Cute History
---

The Volkswagen Beetle was also a perfect example of *cuteness*. The birth of the Volkswagen Beetle was because Hitler wanted to build a *people's car*, a car that’s affordable and practical enough for almost everyone to own one. Interestingly, the name *"Volkswagen"*, literally means "people's car" in German. The car was received by people as *"friendly"*, but didn't it achieve the *friendliness* through being cute?

When Hitler decided he wanted a people’s car (not his idea), and got Porsche to design it (basing it heavily on the ideas of others), he needed a factory to build it and an organization to run it. The organization was called *Kraft durch Freude* which sounds scary in German but is even creepier in English: ***Strength-through-Joy***.

And this strength eventually got the Beetle from Germany to the world, loved by the hippies, allowing them to driving into the woods and hugs some trees.
