title: Humans Can Spot Cuteness In Other Animals
---

The human cuteness detector is set at such a low bar, researchers said, that it sweeps in and deems cute practically anything remotely resembling a human baby or a part thereof, and so ends up including the young of virtually every mammalian species:

- baby ducks & chickens
- woolly bear caterpillars
- a bobbing balloon
- a big round rock stacked on a smaller rock, a colon, a hyphen and a close parenthesis typed in succession.

Observing that many Floridians have an enormous affection for the manatee, which looks like an overfertilized potato with a sock puppet's face, Roger L. Reep of the University of Florida said it shone by grace of contrast. "People live hectic lives, and they may be feeling overwhelmed, but then they watch this soft and slow-moving animal, this gentle giant, and they see it turn on its back to get its belly scratched," said Dr. Reep, author with Robert K. Bonde of "The Florida Manatee: Biology and Conservation."

"That's very endearing," said Dr. Reep. "So even though a manatee is 3 times your size and 20 times your weight, you want to get into the water beside it."

We find animals cute when they share the same traits as human babies, and human nurturing instinct programs us to take cure of anything that looks baby-like, this even works for inanimate objects

**The greater the number of cute features that an animal or object happens to possess, or the more exaggerated the signals may be, the louder and more italicized are the squeals provoked.**
