title: Why Are Babies So Dumb?

- Albert Einstein didn't learn to speak until 3yo

We humans consider ourselves on the top of the food chain, it's true. We've pretty much taken over most places on earth, and if we want, we can kill and eat any other species that we come across, or domesticate them, lock them up in cages, or keep them as pets. All this power we have, we contribute it to this point to brain, our superior intelligence comparing to other animals.

But our bigger brains didn't come for free, [[We Paid Heavy Prices For Our Bigger Brains]]. It turned out, that [[Having A Bigger Brain Really Paid Off]], our human world is much advanced than the animal world.

But all of the advanced abilities have nothing to do with human babies, because [[Human Babies Are Dumb]], **extremely.** Meanwhile, [[Animal Babies Are Pretty Strong]] comparing to our babies. *So what went wrong?*

Evolution might have answers to this question, because [[Evolution Might Lead To Human Premature Births]].

- **Time to maturity, or weaning time has a high correlation with intelligence than brain size**. In other words, the time it takes to shepherd newborns through absolute helplessness to a point of relative self-sufficiency predicts primate intelligence more strongly than the best measure that has previously been proposed, namely, head circumference. Orangutans have smarter babies than baboons and they wean them longer. Baboon babies, in turn, are weaned longer, and are smarter, than lemur babies.
- **The connection between weaning time and intelligence that may really be driving the cycle**. You need to be smarter to care for more helpless creatures, which means you need a larger brainâ€”which means that babies have to enter the world at an even more helpless stage of development, since there is a finite size to their brain at birth, mandated by the physiology of live birth. And so the cycle continues.
- babies are not dumb

    humans have a high cognitive growth potential. babies come preloaded with software to learn any language to the point of mastery within a few years. they can do this with more than one language. also humans have a long neoteny, or development period. most of what our brains do to make user experience more pleasurable is develop associations, there's actually a benefit to having these associations not come preloaded, it allows for adaptive learning. learning combined with a longer neoteny, this may allow parents to pass along their learned associations to the newer model with more success due to similar source codes between the older and newer models. this support would also extend to patches that have been made to source code after the discovery of bugs, hereditary diseases, within it.

    yes, initially human newborn babies may not have much independent survivability. by comparison newborn chimpanzees fare better in terms of mobility and cognitive performance. however, after 6 months the human infants show far greater cognitive ability than chimpanzees. babies need time to grow and develop. this question, imo, is badly posed.

    wanted to throw in some things about the development of the prefrontal cortex but opted out bc this may already be too long.

- prefrontal cortex, a significant part of the brain, in terms of social interactions, that affects how we regulate emotions, control impulsive behavior, assess risk and make long-term plans, takes up to 30 years to develop
