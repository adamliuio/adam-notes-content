title: Evolution Might Lead To Human Premature Births
---

Comparing to other animals, **we are born prematurely when many of their vital systems are still underdeveloped, compensating for our bigger brain size and reduced pelvis bone size for females.** Because we are viviparous, our infants must grow mature enough inside the body to be born, but they can’t be so big that they are unable to come out. And our increased brain size has led to a *trade-off*: **our brain size (including the brain size of human fetuses) increased for our increased intelligence, and female humans' pelvis bone size shrunk and became narrower for our shift to upright gait, which leads to smaller birth canals for baby heads to pass through. And because of this, death in childbirth became a major hazard for human females.**

Human fetuses increase their need for more nutrients as the pregnancy continues, to compensate their need for rapid growth: **By six months of pregnancy, women expend twice their usual energy keeping basic metabolic processes going, a burden that only gets greater as the fetus gets larger.** The typical maximum metabolic rate humans can sustain is between 2 times and 2.5 times average (with some exceptions such as professional cyclists). That means the female body may simply not be able to cycle through enough energy to keep a pregnancy going more than nine months.

Therefore babies' brains must keep maturing in their infancy. **The more intelligent an animal will eventually be, the more relatively immature its brain is at birth.**

Natural selection consequently favoured earlier births. Women who gave birth earlier, when the infant’s brain and head were still relatively small and supple, fared better and lived to have more children.
