title: We Paid Heavy Prices For Our Bigger Brains
---

**Most notably, humans have extraordinarily large brains compared to other animals.** Mammals weighing sixty kilograms have an average brain size of 200 cubic centimetres. The earliest men and women, 2.5 million years ago, had brains of about 600 cubic centimetres. **Modern Sapiens sport a brain averaging 1,200–1,400 cubic centimetres.** Neanderthal brains were even bigger.

However, this bigger brain wan't given to us for free, we paid for it.

**Our brains consume more energy**: In Homo sapiens, the brain accounts for *about 2% - 3% of total body weight*, but it consumes *25% of the body’s energy when the body is at rest*. By comparison, the brains of other apes require only *8%* of rest-time energy. That's why we spent much more time searching for food.

**Our muscles atrophied.** Our bodies diverted energy from biceps to neurons. **Humans are one of the weakest species on earth**: A chimpanzee can’t win an argument with a Homo sapiens, but the ape can rip the man apart like a rag doll.
