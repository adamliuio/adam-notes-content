- A **baby giraffe** can stand within an hour of birth, and can even potentially flee predators on its first day of life.
- A **baby monkey** can grasp its mother and hang on for protection and nourishment.
- When **baby elephants** are born, they walk. When **baby giraffes** are born, they fall a meter to the ground. Then they walk.
- When **baby sea turtles** are born, they waddle toward the sea on their own.
- **Baby zebras** can run within the first 45 minutes of life.

A human infant canâ€™t even hold up its own head.
