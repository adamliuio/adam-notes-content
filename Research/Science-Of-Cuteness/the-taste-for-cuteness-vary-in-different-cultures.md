title: The Taste For Cuteness Vary In Different Cultures
---

It's similar to the love of sugar: everybody has sweetness receptors on the tongue, but some people, and some countries, eat a lot more candy than others.

The cuteness craze is particularly acute in Japan, where it goes by the name "kawaii" and has infiltrated the most masculine of redoubts. Truck drivers display Hello Kitty-style figurines on their dashboards. The police enliven safety billboards and wanted posters with two perky mouselike mascots, Pipo kun and Pipo chan. In the particular case of Japan, "cuteness is used to soften up the vertical society, to soften power relations and present authority without being threatening," says *Brian J. McVeigh*, a scholar of East Asian studies at the University of Arizona.
