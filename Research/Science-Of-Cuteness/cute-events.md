Washington was crazy about panda Tai Shan at its Smithsonian's National Zoo, the first surviving giant panda cub ever born there. Although the zoo's adult pandas have long been among Washington's top tourist attractions, the public debut of the baby on *December 8, 2005* has unleashed an frenzy. Some 13,000 timed tickets to see the cub were snapped up within two hours of being released, and almost immediately began trading on eBay for up to $200 a pair.
