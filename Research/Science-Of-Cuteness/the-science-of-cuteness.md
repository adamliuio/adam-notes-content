title: The Science of Cuteness
---

***Cuteness* describes a type of attractiveness commonly associated with youth and appearance, that makes a creature appear "cute" and activate ("release") in others the motivation to care for it.** Biologist Konard Lorenz researched the "Baby Schema" ("Kindchenschema").

When it comes to biology in humans, cuteness is actually not a choice, [[We Are Evolved To Spot Cuteness]], because [[Babies Have A Unique Growth Pattern]] that gives them all the [[The Elements Of Cuteness]] that make it hard for us to resist falling for them.

And because of this evolutionary nature has been hard coded into our DNA, and because we are so intelligent to a point that our empathy would enable us to relate our sense of cuteness not only to human babies, but to many other things as well, like [[Humans Can Spot Cuteness In Other Animals]], even things too. That's why [[We Are Crazy For Cute Animals]], and cute and colourful cupcakes would give us a big dose of appetite.

More than that, when integrated with designs, [[Cuteness Can Help Spreading Messages]] because people are more willing to accept ideas from a cute character. But this is not all good, [[Cuteness Can Be Used To Exploit Us]], cuteness can be used to get people hooked on things to make profits, we see it in product designs, movies, etc.

While our evolutionary nature for cuteness is universal, [[The Taste For Cuteness Vary In Different Cultures]], Japanese "cuteness" is different from American "cuteness", but we are seeing trends that they are getting more similar.

But [[Cuteness Is Different From Beauty]].
