title: Why Do We Yawn?
---

The verb "to yawn" is derived from the Old English *ganien* or *ginian*, meaning to gape or open wide.

**Yawning is one of our most primitive, fundamental behaviors, yet it might be the least understood.** It turns out, [[Yawning Can Potentially Reveil Much About The Human Body]].

We all know that tiredness, boredom, or seeing someone yawning can make us yawn – but what purpose does it serve the body?

When we yawn out of our own reasons, like tiredness & boredom, it's called *spontaneous yawning*. Spontaneous yawns are so instinctive that [[Human Fetus Observed Yawning]].

[[Contagious Yawning]] differs from *spontaneous yawning* because it occurs when an individual yawns in response to someone else’s yawn.

Yawning is multifactorial. It could be partly an innate form of communication or it could be related to empathy, or a bit of both combined with other factors.

[[Yawning Keeps Us Alerted]], this can explain why [[Yawning Is Common Amongst Animals]]. But in the human world, [[Yawning Is Socially Considered Inappropriate]], because of the fact that boredom can trigger us to yawn, and nobody wants to know they are boring.
### Reasons That Cause Us Yawn

- Yawning is a way our bodies regulate brain temperature: [[Yawning Cools Down The Brain]].

- One reason you may yawn is because the body wants to wake itself up. The motion helps stretch the lungs and their tissues, and it allows the body to flex its muscles and joints. It may also force blood toward your face and brain to increase alertness.

- **You’re showing empathy and bonding.** [The study](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886915003645), published in the journal Personality and Individual Differences, looked at 135 college students, their personalities, and how they reacted to different facial movements. The results showed that the less empathy a person had, the less likely they would yawn after seeing someone else yawn.
