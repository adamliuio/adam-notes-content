title: Contagious Yawning Might Help Synchronize Group Activity

> "It’s often said that behavior doesn’t leave fossils,” Provine says. “But, with yawning, you are looking at a behavioral fossil. You’re getting an insight into how all of behavior once was." - Robert Provine, a neuroscientist.

Yawns are replicated by observers who pass their yawns along from one to another in a behavioral chain reaction. **This synchronizes the behavioral and physiological state of a group**. The underlying mechanism of the contagious response probably involves some sort of *neurological detector* for yawns, but the wide range of yawn-producing stimuli suggests that the detector must be broadly tuned. Contagious yawning definitely *does not involve a conscious desire to replicate the observed act* ("I think I'll yawn just like that person did")—we yawn whether we want to or not.

**Contagious yawning is species-typical, neurologically programmed social behavior of a sort neglected by social scientists, who usually emphasize the role of the environment in shaping the behavior of individuals.** The involvement of an unconsciously controlled human universal broadens the discussion of a variety of social behavior.

Like *contagious laughter*, the basis of the notorious television laugh tracks, is another compelling case of unconsciously controlled pseudo-imitative behavior.

Instead of what we generally think of yawning is about, the contagious nature of yawning might be *a primal form of sociality*. At its root, yawning might act as a mechanism of *social signalling*. **When we yawn, we are communicating with one another, we are sending an external signal to let the group get rid of our boredom, anxiety, fatigue, or feelings of hunger, and focus on something together**, presumably potential threatsof what we generally think. It’s less likely a signal that you’re tired than a signal that it’s time for everyone around you to act.

[[Contagious Yawning]] may be a way for animals who live together to coordinate activities. Since dogs and humans have been living together for between 14,000 and 30,000 years, contagious yawning may be deeply rooted in canine evolutionary history. Dogs’ longstanding relationships with us may have enabled them to reach across species lines to feel what we’re feeling.

Some researchers have wondered if contagious yawning might be a primitive form of communication – if so, what information is it transmitting? Christian Hess (at the University of Bern in Switzerland) believes that the signalling role of yawning is to help to synchronize the behaviour of a social group – to make them go to sleep more or less at the same time. With the same routine, a group can then work together more efficiently throughout the day.
