title: Contagious Yawning
---

It's extremely common for *almost all of us to yawn when we see or hear others yawning, as well as when we think about yawning*. It is a well-documented phenomenon.

Figure explanation: What features prompt contagious yawns? Independent groups of 30 subjects viewed five-minute videotapes of an adult male yawning. Subjects who viewed normal yawns were **twice** (55 percent) as likely to yawn as subjects who viewed a series of smiles (21 percent). When the faces were edited to test which features were most potent in prompting yawns, the gaping mouth did not turn out to be the most potent stimulus. **Yawning faces whose mouths were masked were as effective as intact faces in producing yawns**. And **The yawn video proved equally potent whether viewed right side up, sideways or upside down, and it didn't make a difference whether the video wasviewed in black and white or in color**.

Yawns are so infectious that not to even mention seeing others yawn, by simply reading or thinking about them can trigger an infectious response in ourselves. This contagiousness can be used as an opportunity to understand our social behaviors (i.e. empathy, imitation) from a neurological perspective, as well as to improve our understanding in the pathology of autism, schizophrenia and brain damage.

By spreading from person to person, contagious yawns could therefore help a whole group stay focus and alerted. That's why study shows that [[Seeing other people yawn selectively enhances vigilance]].

The mechanisms that drive contagious yawning are as yet unknown, but research shows that *viewing someone yawn evokes unique neural activity in the posterior cingulate and precuneus*. Because of the role these areas play in self-processing (e.g., self-referential processing, theory of mind, autobiographical memory), findings suggest that contagious yawning may be part of a neural network involved in empathy, which means, [[Contagious Yawning Can Relate To Empathy]].
