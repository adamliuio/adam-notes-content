title: Human Fetus Observed Yawning
---

Just like hiccuping, stretching & *yawning* is such an instinct that human fetus are [observed yawning](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378378282900330) as early as during the first trimester in the womb, healthy babies yawned less as they approached their birth dates, and [research](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0050569) shows that yawning decreased steadily from nearly twice every 10 minutes in foetuses at 24 weeks gestation, to none at 36 weeks.

While *spontaneous yawning* occurs as early as the 12th week in the womb, **[[Contagious Yawning]] develops only several years after birth, suggesting a separate and relatively recent evolutionary origin**. Interestingly, the development of empathy also follows similar pattern. Children younger than five donâ€™t yawn any more often when watching videos of yawns than they would normally.
