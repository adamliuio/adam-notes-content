title: Reducing Temperature Can Help Stopping Yawning
---

In a test examining whether people are more or less likely to yawn in different temperatures, Andrew Gallup (at the State University of New York at Oneonta) found that around 48% felt the urge to yawn, but when he asked them to hold a cold compress to their foreheads, just 9% succumbed. Breathing through the nose, which could also cool the brain by *promoting the evaporation of the sinus mucosa*, was even more effective, completely dampening his subjects’ urge to yawn – potentially suggesting a handy trick for anyone facing embarrassment during a tedious conversation.

2 troubled women who approached Gallup soon after he first published his results. Both were looking for relief from **pathological yawning attacks, sometimes lasting an hour at a time**. "It was extremely debilitating and interferes with any basic activity,” says Gallup. “They’d have to walk away and go to a secluded area – it affected their personal and professional lives.” Intriguingly, one of the women found **the only way to stop the yawning attack was to throw herself into cold water**. Inspired, Gallup asked them to place a thermometer in their mouths before and after the attacks. Sure enough, he saw **a slight rise in temperature just before the yawning bouts, which continued until it dropped back to 37C**.
