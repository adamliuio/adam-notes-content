title: Yawning Cools Down The Brain
---

**Cooling of the brain boosts its performance**, so contagious yawning may be an evolutionary trait meant to improve overall alertness in groups of people and animals.

[[Reducing Temperature Can Help Stopping Yawning]], but yawning helps us cooling the brain. Slightly cooling down the brain might make us more alert – waking us up when we are bored and distracted.

[Research](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2012.00188/full) in 2013 found that there are **3 main processes** have been described for how yawning could cool brain temperature in mammals and birds. Below we apply them specifically to humans.

1. Yawning produces significant changes in circulation, including acceleration in heart rate and elevation of blood pressure. More specifically:
   - powerful jaw stretching during yawning produces increases in neck, head, and facial blood flow
   - the deep inspiration during yawning produces significant downward flow in cerebrospinal fluid and an increase in blow flow in the internal jugular vein.
   - The network of veins within the lateral pterygoid muscle has been described to operate as a peripheral pump, and the powerful and extended contraction of these muscles during yawning acts to squeeze blood from the associated plexus.
   - Brain temperature is consistently 0.2°C higher than that of arterial blood supplying the brain, and that on average, 0.66J of heat energy per minute per gram is released from the brain through blood flow.
   - As a result, the aforementioned processes during yawning act like a radiator by **removing hyperthermic blood from brain and simultaneously introducing cooler blood from the lungs and extremities**, thereby cooling cortical surfaces through convection.

2. **It is hypothesized that yawning also provides a direct heat exchange from the deep inhalation of cooler ambient air.** The air exchange during yawning would cool venous blood draining from the nasal and oral orifices into the cavernous sinus, which surrounds the internal carotid artery supplying blood to the rest of the brain. Again, this would provide a cooling effect through convection. Furthermore, **it has recently been discovered that pharyngeal cooling rapidly and selectively decreases brain temperature in primates, and tympanic temperature in humans, by cooling the carotid arteries**.

3. It has recently been discovered that the posterior wall of the maxillary sinus serves as an origin for both medial and lateral pterygoid muscle segments, which allows the thin sinus walls to flex when the pterygoid musculature contracts during jaw activity such as yawning. This powerful flexing of the sinus walls has been proposed to ventilate the human sinus system similar to that described in birds, providing yet another mechanism for cerebral cooling by yawning in humans. Accordingly, **yawning could reduce brain temperature by ventilating the sinus system and promoting the evaporation of the sinus mucosa.**
