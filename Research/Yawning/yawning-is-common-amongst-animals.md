title: Yawning Is Common Amongst Animals

Yawning is very common amongst vertebrates.

Yawning's evolutionary history can be deduced from its occurrence around the animal kingdom. **Most vertebrates yawn**—snakes, hippopotami and owls as well as jungle cats—suggesting that **yawning has an ancient pedigree**.

Yet **contagious (not just simultaneous) yawning has been demonstrated convincingly only in two primates, human beings and chimpanzees**.

[[Contagious Yawning Might Help Synchronize Group Activity]]

Yawning may be an unspoken form of communication, but it's not unique to people. Some species of primates and canines yawn in response to each others' yawns, and dogs will even yawn after a person yawns.

A body of research shows that dogs are more likely to yawn when their owners do because they experience [[Contagious Yawning]] as well.

A [University of Tokyo study](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/focus/en/articles/a_00186.html) found that just over half the dogs monitored yawned after watching their owners yawn. The researchers also had the dogs watch a stranger yawn, resulting in dogs yawning about half as frequently. What’s more, a [University of Portugal study](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/thoughtful-animal/contagious-yawning-evidence-of-empathy/) found that 12 of 29 dogs yawned when they heard a recording of their owners yawning.

These results show the emotional bond between people and their dogs may be reciprocal.
