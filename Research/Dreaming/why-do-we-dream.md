title: Why do we dream?

MIT found spatial activity during sleep in brain, this happens in the brains of rodents, primates, humans, i.e. London cab drivers.

- Dreaming is not just for the sake of remembering things, but rather, **if there's a reason to remember at all**. More importantly, dreams are linked to emotions, if you get shouted at by your spouse, or had a car crash, **you dream about your experiences so you link experience to context**, and spatial information is very important in this context.
- [[Rem Sleep]]
- If you're deprived of REM sleep long enough, you become irritable and start to link negative emotions to almost everything
- the dreams we experience during REM sleep is when we divorce emotion from our prior experiences, it's when we extract general rules and themes
- the replay of neurons in the hippocampus & else where in the brain is kind of an approximation the previous episode and a lot of fear unlearning of uncoupling emotion from hard and traumatic events that happened previously occurs in REM sleep
- so REM dreams tend to be intense, and you don't wanna be deprived of it for too long, and because your Epinephrine level is low so you can't suddenly act out of your dreams. But sometimes people can wake up during REM dreams, and their hearts would beat really fast, that's a surge of Epinephrine occurs as you exit REM sleep
- So you are having this intense emotional experience without the fear, it's basically self-induced trauma therapy where you try and divorce the emotion from the experience in your sleep
- People also experience atonia (paralysis) into the waking state, basically you're awake but you can't move, which can be terrifying
- REM sleep is good for forgetting the bad stuff, it's good for uncoupling the emotions from bad experiences, there are 2 therapies:
    1. Eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing, which shuts down the amygdala during therapy not during sleep
    2. ketamine, a dissociative analgesic, very similar to pcp. ketamine is now being used in trauma therapy to help people who have experienced traumatic things to shut off the emotional system, because you don't forget about the bad stuff, but it's possible to uncouple the bad events from the emotional system, so people can recount the traumatic events without triggering the same somatic experiences or terror and dread, because these feelings can be debilitating. There are ethical debates about whether this approach is good or bad, but PTSD is a failure to uncouple the emotion from traumatic experiences.
- Thematically REM sleep experiencing & replaying the intense experiences without experience the somatic (or the physical component of the) emotion, uncoupling the physical sensation from the mental events
