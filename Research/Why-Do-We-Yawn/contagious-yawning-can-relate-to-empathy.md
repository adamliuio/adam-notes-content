title: Contagious Yawning Can Relate To Empathy
---

Recently Steven Platek of Drexel University and colleagues Feroze B. Mohamed of Temple University and Gordon G. Gallup, Jr., of the State University of New York at Albany used functional magnetic-resonance imaging to study activity in people exposed to yawns. They found unique activity in the posterior cingulate and precuneus brain regions, areas not associated with mirror activity. These regions are, instead, associated with such self-processing functions as self-reference, theory of mind and autobiographical memory. **In an unconscious way, someone who "catches" a yawn may be expressing a primal form of empathy.**

On the contrary, *intense self-awareness*, as when you are being observed or even suspect that you may be observed, **inhibits yawning**.

## Social Bond

[[Contagious Yawning]]
is found out to be related to empathy, and that people with higher levels of empathy yawn more often when someone else yawns, and people with higher levels of empathy generally tend to have better social skills. The observed disappearance of yawning in certain neurological and psychiatric disorders also suggests that ***contagious yawning* could potentially be a measure of sociality**.

In Homo sapiens and some non-human primates **contagious yawning is higher between strongly than weakly bonded individuals.** That's why **how close we feel to someone affects how likely we are to yawn when they do.** We’re more likely to catch a yawn from a family member than from a friend, a friend versus an acquaintance, and an acquaintance versus a stranger.

A research on auditory yawns (only yawns that could be heard but not seen by potential responders) [Auditory Contagious Yawning Is Highest Between Friends and Family Members: Support to the Emotional Bias Hypothesis](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00442/full) showed that the social bond significantly predicted the occurrence of auditory yawn contagion, which was highest between friends and family members. A gender bias was also observed, with women responding most frequently to others’ yawns and men being responded to most frequently by others. These results confirm that **social bond is per se one of the main drivers of the differences in yawn contagion rates between individuals in support of the EBH of yawn contagion.**

## Mental Disorders

Researches have shown that **yawning may not be as contagious to people with lower levels of empathy or those with certain neurological and psychiatric disorders (which would lead the patients to have an impaired/diminished ability to infer the mental states of others), like autism or schizophrenia, while their ability of spontaneous yawning remains intact.** Provocatively, the late Canadian psychiatrist Heinz Lehmann claimed that increases in yawning (contagious yawning was not specifically examined) could predict recovery in schizophrenia.

In addition, children under the age of 4 (their ability for empathy haven't fully developed yet) and older adults (their ability for empathy is decreasing) are less likely to yawn in response to somebody else yawning.

More on that, [[contagious yawning is linked to psychopathy]], meaning that **psychopaths aren't so susceptible to *contagious yawning*.**

## Conclusion

The contagiousness of yawning, and vocalizations like laughter & crying may either tap a primitive neurological substrate for social behavior or be confined to that specific behavior and not reflect a more general social process, we still don't know. *Judgment about contagiousness as evidence for a trait of sociality must, then, await further research.*
