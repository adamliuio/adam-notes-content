title: Yawning Keeps Us Alerted
---

Researchers used to think that yawning was only signaling a need for sleep, turns out [it's not true](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0031938495020144). *"Yawning frequency is unrelated to prior amount of sleep, or to times of awaking or retiring. More yawning occurred during the week than during weekends."*

but now they believe that it can communicate a shift in alertness or boredom.

A series of studies conducted in the eighties and nineties demonstrated that people report yawning more frequently when they are **feeling tired**. They are especially prone to yawning in the hour immediately after waking and the hour preceding their usual bedtimes.

[[Yawning Increases With Boredom]], and we also **yawn when we’re getting hungry**—a tendency we appear to share with other primates.

**Boredom, hunger, fatigue**: these are all states in which we may find our *attention drifting and our focus becoming more and more difficult to maintain*. This is when yawning becomes a signal that helps our bodies to stay alert. Just as a [research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21331826/) stated: *A major function of yawning appears to involve maintenance or increase of arousal when environments provide relatively little stimulation.*

You don't have to be bored to yawn. Athletes sometimes yawn before games, live performers may yawn before getting on stage. The incidence of yawning would go up just before Army Special Forces soldiers they made their way to the cabin door before jumping out of an airplane for the first time.

Robert Provine (a neuroscientist) believes, **a yawn may signal a change of physiological state**: a way to help our mind and body transition from one behavioral state to another—"sleep to wakefulness, wakefulness to sleep, anxiety to calm, boredom to alertness."
