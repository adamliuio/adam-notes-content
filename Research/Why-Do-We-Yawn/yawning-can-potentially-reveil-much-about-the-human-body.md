title: Yawning Can Potentially Reveil Much About The Human Body
---

The study of yawning can be dated back to Antiquity, hundreds of years before BC, [[Hippocrates Hypothesized That Yawning Precedes Fever]], and in 1923, British neurologist [[Sir Francis Walshe Discovered Yawning Improves Motor Function]].

Clinical neurology offers other surprises. **Some patients with "locked-in" syndrome, who are almost totally deprived of the ability to move voluntarily, can yawn normally**. The neural circuits for spontaneous yawning must exist in the brain stem near other respiratory and vasomotor centers, because yawning is performed by anencephalics who possess only the medulla oblongata. The multiplicity of stimuli of contagious yawning, by contrast, implicates many higher brain regions.

Yawning apparently activates undamaged, unconsciously controlled connections between the brain and the cord motor system innervating the paralyzed limb.

Yet yawning's biological function still remains a mystery. It is not known whether the associated response is a positive prognosis for recovery, nor whether yawning is therapeutic for reinnervation or prevention of muscular atrophy.
