title: Yawning Increases With Boredom
---

Yawning **increases with boredom**. In one experiment, the study's subjects were separated into 2 groups, 1 group was asked to watch a television test pattern for 30 minutes, while another was asked to watch music videos for 30 minutes. Subjects yawned *yawned far more frequently (about 70 percent more) when looking at static TV screen than when watching music videos*.

Consider the Bakairi people of central Brazil as observed by their first European visitor, 19th-century ethnologist Karl von den Steinen. Iren√§us Eibl-Eibesfeldt recalls in his 1975 book Ethology that Steinen reported: "If they seemed to have had enough of all the talk, they began to yawn unabashedly and without placing their hands before their mouths. That the pleasant reflex was contagious could not be denied. One after the other got up and left until I remained with my dujour." Among all members of our species, the chain reaction of contagious yawning synchronizes the behavioral as well as the physiological state of our tribe. Yawning is a reminder that ancient and unconscious behavior lurks beneath the veneer of culture, rationality and language, continuing to influence our lives.
