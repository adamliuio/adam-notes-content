title: Hippocrates Hypothesized That Yawning Precedes Fever
---

*Hippocrates* arguably the first person who studied yawns nearly 2,500 years ago, he considered yawning to be an exhaustion of the fumes preceding fever. He believed that yawning helped to release noxious air, particularly during a fever. "*Like the large quantities of steam that escape from cauldrons when water boils, the accumulated air in the body is violently expelled through the mouth when the body temperature rises*," he wrote.
