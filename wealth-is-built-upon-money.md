title: "Wealth Is Built Upon Money"
---

Wealth need to be built upon money. If you Google the word "wealth" the dominant explanation is it means financial assets. It's simply because money has become the glue of society and we're so dependent on money nowadays. But I do believe that true wealth involves a lot of things beyond money that money can't buy, like happiness & genuine human relationships. But you're not gonna be able to fully enjoy these things if money is something you lack of and you have to spend all your time chasing after.

That's why the first step to build wealth is to be financially literate, so you can be financially sound. This will not only help you to make money and create wealth from there, it would also help you defending and protecting yourself financially. For instance, lots of people don't know about the fact governments are printing huge amount of money these days (it's 2020 atm), or don't understand why it would destroy their savings and the economy, not to even mention how we've got here the first place.
