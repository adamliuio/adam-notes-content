title: Stoned Ape Theory

The "Stoned Ape" Theory was proposed by [Terence McKenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_McKenna) which posits that the development of the human brain might have come from the apes experimenting with psychedelic mushrooms.

As rainforest reseeded into grasslands, amongst other animals, ancient apes were forced to migrate to new areas, and needed try new foods in order to survive because their habitat was changing, these apes found psychedelic mushrooms along with other foods, which was growing everywhere since the whether was suitable for psychedelic mushrooms to grow.

It's proven that in low doses, psilocybin increases visual acuity. So when the apes ate these psychedelic mushrooms, the psilocybin contained in them improved the apes' mental abilities, helped them acquiring new information-processing & imagination capabilities, which gave them more powerful brains. The shrooms also made them to see better, so they became better at hunting games for food, as well as made them hornier, which made them more likely to breed, so the ape population grew dramatically along with the increased intelligence.

Many modern users of psychedelics claim the world never looks the same again after such an experience. As McKenna put it, "**Homo sapiens ate our way to a higher consciousness,**" and, "**It was at this time that religious ritual, calendar making, and natural magic came into their own.**"

But here's the thing, the it's just a theory, and Michael Pollan said once that it's unclear how eating something would make a species evolve on a genetic level, which I agree. In addition to that, how did we evolve into a species that's so ignorant when it comes to nature when the enhanced awareness of nature is commonly described by people after consuming psychedelic drug?
