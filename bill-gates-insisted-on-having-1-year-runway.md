title: Bill Gates Insisted on Having 1 Year Runway
---

From the day Bill Gates started Microsoft, he insisted on **always having enough cash in the bank to keep the company alive for 12 months with no revenue coming in**.

In 1995 he was asked by Charlie Rose why he kept so much cash on hand. **“Things change so fast in technology that next year’s business wasn’t guaranteed”, he said, “Including Microsoft’s.”**

In 2007 he reflected:

**“I was always worried because people who worked for me were older than me and had kids, and I always thought, ‘What if we don’t get paid, will I be able to meet the payroll?’”**
