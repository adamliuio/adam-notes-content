title: "Great Filter Theory: We Are One Of The First"

We are the only intelligent life form, or we are amongst other intelligent life forms that have appeared in the universe since the creation of the universe so far and are evolving towards super-intelligence.

The universe itself is relatively young, it's assumed to be 13.6 billion years old, and suggested to last for around 200 billion years (I still need to do more research on that), so on a 100-year lifespan scale, the universe is only 6.8 years old.

And since the Earth is even younger, it makes sense to think that we are the only one or one of the earliest intelligent life forms exist. And because we still have a long way to go, our current technologies are too primitive for us to see further and discover more of the universe, because so far we can only see a tiny bit of the universe.

So if there are other possible civilisations exist in the universe, they are possibly stuck in their own tiny neighbourhood in the universe as well, and the distance between us is so huge that we won't be able to know each others' existance for a long long time.
