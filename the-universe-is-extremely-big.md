title: The Universe Is Extremely Big
---

On an extremely clear starry night, and assume that you are at somewhere with the best conditions, it's roughly estimated that we can see between 5,000 and 2,500 stars. It might seem very vast to you, the human, but don't get fool by your perspective, you're looking at an *EXTREMELY* small area of the universe.
