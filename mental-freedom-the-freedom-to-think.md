One's *mental freedom* is not much from their [[Physical Freedom: Being Able To Move]]. While living in Australia gave me much calmer mental states, it's not enough. The human mind has huge potentials that most people have never taken full advantage of, and in my opinion the main reasons for that is because *we are not exposed to enough new ideas, new cultures, and new perspectives*.

Ultimately, the point of having physical freedom is to free our minds. With a healthy and strong body, one can see, hear, learn, understand better, all of these activities enhance our mental abilities. And with better mental abilities, one has much better changes to achieve better things.
