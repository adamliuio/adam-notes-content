Compounding is easy to understand, but easy to underestimate & forget about as well, because it’s not intuitive, even for smart people. Michael Batnick once explained it: 

> If I ask you to calculate 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 in your head, you can do it in a few seconds (it’s 72). If I ask you to calculate 8 x 8 x 8 x 8 x 8 x 8 x 8 x 8 x 8, your head will explode (it’s 134,217,728).

This theory is real, and many successful people have used it to their advantage to excel fast.

When [Mark Cuban took over the Dallas Mavericks team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks#1998%E2%80%932001:_New_beginnings), he improved lots of things, from the food & medical support they provided to their athletes, the hotels the athletes stayed in when they were on the road, as well as the customer experience in the stadium, etc. And from Cuban's perspective, he was "putting ourselves in a position to succeed". Which they did, they became the NBA champion in 2011 after Cuban took over the team since 2000.

If the odds are in your favour and you can keep them in your favour for a long time, you shouldn’t just be an optimist. You should be a ridiculous, full-blown, giddy optimistic.

As long as more people try to get better than screw up, the long-term odds are in an economy’s favour. And that’s virtually always the case because the screw-ups – the declines, the recessions, and panics, the wars – fuel the problem-solving.

Once the odds are in your favour, compounding takes hold. And then …. boom.

In blackjack, casinos usually have a 0.5% edge over players, which is enough to guarantee they’ll win over time. The best card-counters give themselves about a 2% edge over the house, which is enough to ensure they’ll win over time.
