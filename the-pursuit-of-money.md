## Never Chase After Money

Money is a servant, you have to be the master of it. Use it, control it, but don't bow to it and be the servant of it, because it won't treat you as a servant, but a slave.

## Attract Money

*<Underline>Money can not be chased after, but it can be attracted to you.</Underline>* The best way to attract money is to find worthy gaps to fill, the worthiest gaps are the problems people face, and the desires people have. The bigger the gap, the bigger the reward the person who bridges the gap gets.

People are not getting enough nutrition their bodies **need** from the food they eat these days, it's a **problem**. You provide them good vitamin or mineral suppliments, the problem can be solved.

People are socially awkward these days, but they still desire love and want to get laid. You create an app for them to flirt with surrounding boys and girls freely, you fill their desire.

**And you own the solution to these desires & problems. So when their problems get solved, you get paid.**
