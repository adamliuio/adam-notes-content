We are all trying to build a better future for ourselves. We go to school, go to college, get jobs to make a living, try to get promoted, fall in love with the people that we think is right for us, give birth to babies to carry our hopes and dreams and love, and we do our best to provide everything for them.

Beyond our own interests, a lot of us also have bigger goals and dreams, trying to make the world a better place, doing our parts to help others, creating useful things to provide value to others, things like that.

In my last post - [[The Future Of My Life]] - touching on the boat life idea I have, I'm going to expand on this idea. And my last post was written more than 8 months ago, I've gone through huge emotional roller coaster during this period. And now, while my mentality has shifted to certain extent, the boat life idea has become much more important to me.

In my last post I briefly mentioned the *pro*s of the boat life:

1. You can travel the world in your house
   - this reconciles the conflicts between travelling the world while maintaining a sense of belonging).
2. You can travel to the untouched or the least touched land
   - I want to experience as much as possible, so this would include both the human cultures and the natural world, while most human cultures can be accessed by common transportation methods, some remote nature sightings can only be accessed by boat).

What I forgot to mention, are a couple of things I really care about and also made me believe this is the right choice for me:

1. I want to maximise my freedom, both physical & mental freedom.
2. I want to protect my peace of mind.
3. I don't want to suffer from the drama other people have created.
4. To minimise the negative human & environmental impact that I personally have to deal with.
5. To be extremely flexible while having a sense of stability.
6. I want to minimise my carbon emission.

Let me expand on these points briefly:

1. Physical & mental freedom: being free to move and enjoy nature, to expand our minds & consciousness.
   - **Being able to move.** While the modern society has improved our quality of life, we've also sacrificed our sanity. In my opinion, most of the mental issues people have, including hatred, axiety, hopelessness, are all from these advancements. For instance, megacities are the best representations of human advancements, big money flow through them, big dreams are made there. I live in Shanghai for a while, in the last year of my 2-year stay in Shanghai, I started to prefering staying at home whenever I could, because I was becoming claustrophobic when I go out and seeing crowds (big crowds are everywhere in Shanghai) before I've ever heard the word "claustrophobic". And since then, least crowded places are what I've been longing for.
   - **The freedom to think.** One's mental freedom is not separated much from their physical freedom. While moving out of Shanghai gave me much calmer mental states, it's not enough. The human mind has huge potentials that most people have never taken full advantage of, and in my opinion the main reasons for that is because we are not exposed to enough new ideas, new cultures, and new perspectives. To be able to move, to be able to free our bodies, ultimately is to free our minds. With a healthy and strong body, one can see, hear, learn, understand better. With a boat, one can go further and longer than ever before.
2. Peace of mind: the inner calmness we all need.
   - **A place to think.** Monks find their peace through meditation, practice of a lifetime, which is something most regular people are not able to do. But maybe it's not that necessary for us to go to the extent only a few masters can achieve. Maybe the point of them getting enlightened, is to point the rest of us to the direction that works, so we can save ourselves from the chaos of the human world to some extent. To me, a boat floating in the middle of the windless ocean would provide the ultimate peace of mind, there's nothing there, not even birds can stay there to sing, what's left is only you and your thoughts.

3. Avoiding human made drama: I don't want to be a victim.
   - **A life with no drama.** It all started with my hatred towards having to spend time to deal with shitty people: I've had a giant construction site set up right in front of my window without any notice, and filling my apartment with noise & crazy amount of dust **24/7!!!** for more than a year because I didn't have time to move; I hate that I have to lose sleep because my neighbours deside to party all night; I hate that I am forces to deal with office politics because it is effecting me, rather than spending my time working on something useful. This list can go on for a long while, but the main point is that I know I can't change others, while I can always talk shit about what I don't like, what I really need is to not get effected by anything I don't like. This is not being a pussy & escaping from the fight, because escaping from these things require great effort, this is withdrawing myself from the endless unnecessary struggle, and putting myself into a position so that I can work on things that are really going to provide value to others.
4. Avoiding the negative human & environmental impact.
   - I'm scared of climate change, not only because it will bring significant change to our lives, but also becasue the reason we are only starting to take it seriously now (2021), is because climate change is not only a climate issue, a significant part of it is the human politics. That's why I said ***"human & environmental impact"***. Now, I have no power to help in any aspect in terms of climate change on a big scale as an individual at the moment, while I do want to build my businesses asap and make sure I have enough time and money to help reducing climate change, I also want to have the safest way of life for my family. And a boat can also deliver it. Yes, the ocean is like a sensitive thermometer, it would be affected drastically, but in my opinion, the disastrous events happening in the ocean would be easier to avoid as a family when compared to sudden wildfires & toxic smokes when all your life belongings are in one house, and a car can only take so much luggage, not to even mention the blocked traffic when evacuating. While a boat is definitely not the perfect solution, but it's definitely better than anything else I can imagine.
5. To flexible and stable at the same time.
   - I do believe as homo sapiens, we still have the need for movement & exploration passed down from our ancestors, that's why the travel industry was booming before COVID hit, that's also why "getting away" always sounds so good! But I also think we do look for stability in life, we are all longing for a place safe from all dangers, a place we can stay at and enjoy life, this is also the reason our ancestors settled down and started growing agriculture, which is a very hard thing to do back then. But if you travel, you can barely bring anything with you; and if you remain stable, you can barely travel and see the world. And a boat can bridge these 2. You can always travel, and always bring your home with you. If you like a place and want to stay there for longer, just anchor there.
6. Minimise my carbon emission while travel meaningfully.
   - **Carbon emission**: Sailboats are pretty much the most eco-friendly transportation tools existing in my opinion, due to the reason it uses wind most of the time. So it would be the best choice of travel for anyone who wants to contribute the least to global warming.
   ![venice-crowds](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9758779/131056944-a0e61255-086b-436c-bfbf-2f7eeae526f5.png)
   - **Meaningful travel**: One of the undesired consequences of the booming of the travel industry is the huge increase of carbon emission, and the destruction of the beauty of the tourist attractions. Instead of enjoying the beauty of historical sites & local cultures, traveling for most people have become a money spending & photo taking journey so they can go back and show their friends where they've been, as well as enjoying a day of two of the life they saw in movies, sipping on apple martini by the pool in a resort compond, posing in front of the Eiffel Tower, shit like that. And of course, this is a no no for me.

Of course nothing is perfect in this world, so the boat life also has many *con*s, things regularly break, sea sickness, the weather can make situations dangerous, etc. But you live and you learn, and with pressure you learn faster, it's much better than having a 9-5 job and watching TV for the rest of my life.

I still have a long way to go, but I do believe this long road can be finished sooner if I run faster, which means I need to work harder & smarter.

> No time to waste, *Godspeed*.
