title: The Univers Is Extremely Vast
---

The Universe is too vast that it encompasses incredibly small like atoms (which forms planets and stars) and the unbelievably gigantic objects (stars, planets, comets), as well as systems/regions of objects (superclusters, black holes, galaxies).

And not only the distances between these objects are beyond our comprehension that we need to use different units of measurement (i.e. *astronomical units*, *light years*) other than the ones used on earth.

Temperatures range from near *Aabsolute Zero* to millions of degrees in the interiors of stars.

Objects with the size of a sugar cube in the universe can also have mass of **100 million tonnes**.

The universe contains billions of galaxies, while each of these galaxies contain hundreds of millions of stars and trillions of planets. And the universe is still extremely empty, it's such a vacuum that it only has 5.9 protons per cubic meter on average (including dark energy and dark matter).
