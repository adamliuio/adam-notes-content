title: Great Filter
---

There's something that prevents non-living matter from becoming life (abiogenesis) and then eventually turn into Type III intelligence on the Kardashev Scale. This "something" is the stage that would make it almost impossible for any kind of life to proceed beyond it.

The Great Filter theory is a possible explanation to the Fermi Paradox: [[Where Are the Aliens?]].

*But where is the Great Filter?*

Maybe the great filter is [[Great Filter Theory: The Formation Of Life Itself]].

Or maybe it's because [[Great Filter Theory: We Are One Of The First]].

Or maybe [[Great Filter Theory: We Are Yet To Extinct]].

1. We’re Fucked (The Great Filter is Ahead of Us)

We're fucked.

If we’re neither rare nor early, Group 1 thinkers conclude that The Great Filter must be in our future. This would suggest that life regularly evolves to where we are, but that something prevents life from going much further and reaching high intelligence in almost all cases—and we’re unlikely to be an exception.

One possible future Great Filter is a regularly-occurring cataclysmic natural event, like the above-mentioned gamma-ray bursts, except they’re unfortunately not done yet and it’s just a matter of time before all life on Earth is suddenly wiped out by one. Another candidate is the possible inevitability that nearly all intelligent civilizations end up destroying themselves once a certain level of technology is reached.

This is why Oxford University philosopher Nick Bostrom says that “no news is good news.” The discovery of even simple life on Mars would be devastating, because it would cut out a number of potential Great Filters behind us. And if we were to find fossilized complex life on Mars, Bostrom says “it would be by far the worst news ever printed on a newspaper cover,” because it would mean The Great Filter is almost definitely ahead of us—ultimately dooming the species. Bostrom believes that when it comes to The Fermi Paradox, “the silence of the night sky is golden.”
