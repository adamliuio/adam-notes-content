**Having a place to think is extremely important.**

Monks find their peace through meditation in temples, and they would practice it for their entire life, which is something most regular people are not able to do.

But maybe it's not that necessary for every single one of us to go to the extremes only a few masters can achieve. Maybe the point of them reaching the pinnacle of enlightenment, is to point the rest of us to the direction that works, so we can save our own sanities from the chaos of the human world we live in.
To me, a boat floating in the middle of the windless ocean would provide the ultimate peace of mind, there would be nothing there, not even birds can stay there to sing, what's left is only you and your thoughts.
