**The more I think about it, the more I feel the earth is Fucked.**

Climate change, plastic overuse, massive industrial pollution... I don't think I need to keep listing, and just do a bit of Googling you'll find the stats to support these claims.

If you only like money, or like whatever seems fancy or luxurious, or you're simply too busy getting through your everyday life, and you don't know how good a better environment can make you feel both mentally & physically, these environmental concerns wouldn't bother you that much, and the people who are calling for change and protesting would seem crazy to you. However, if you are aware of how bad environments can effect your mental & physical health, and you prefer to be healthier, then you would naturally be more sensitive to the environment you're in. It's just like if you're a non-smoker, and all of a sudden you're locked on an airplane in the 1960s, pretty much getting hotboxed by all the passengers around you, would you still simply chill in your seat?

What I'm trying to say is, I'm not a saint, or I am not trying to make myself seem to hold some moral high ground than others, simply because my experiences and awareness brought these concerns to me, doesn't mean others who are not aware of them are bad, or I'm against them. It takes time and effort and certain experiences for people to understand different or new perspectives, so I'm not blaming anybody. (feels very unnecessary to mention this here, but nowadays on the internet, things are taken out of context very easily, and this article is on the internet. So... kinda have to)

My Mission has 3 parts, they are intertwined with each other, and that's the purpose:

1. I want to have a boat life, and explore the ocean and remote places.
2. I want to build *businesses* with great impacts and good intentions, being extremely conscious about the values as well as the environmental & social cost.
3. And show people great stories can really change lives.
