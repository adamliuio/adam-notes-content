title: Science Doesn't Prove Anything
---

The history of science is the history of invalidating what we got wrong before. And our ability to invalidate previous beliefs & theories is from our updated understanding of the world. In science nothing is perfectly right or wrong, only "it's not invalidated yet".

Use physics as an example.

Physics is helpful but it does not prove anything, even the most basic concepts. Theoretical models are mathematical constructs which, together with the postulates of the theory, fit data and predict new behaviors. Scientific theories can only be falsified, or validated by experimental results. Not prove, because they are not pure mathematics with QED attached in proving theorems.
