The Pawn: Idea (Multipliers)

- **Awful idea** = -1
- **Weak idea** = 1
- **So-so idea** = 5
- **Good idea** = 25
- **Great idea** = 100
- **Brilliant idea** = 1000

The King: Execution (Accelerator Pressure)

- **No execution** = $1
- **Weak execution** = $1,000
- **So-so execution** = $10,000
- **Good execution** = $100,000
- **Great execution** = $1,000,000
- **Brilliant execution** = $10,000,000

Those who say "execution is king and ideas are shit", can be described as:

*Awful idea* \* *Brilliant execution* = -$10,000,000

Those who have genius ideas and don't act on them:

*Brilliant idea* \* *No execution* = $1,000

**Those who work hard on developing great ideas and execute brilliantly**:

<Box>Brilliant idea * Brilliant execution > $10,000,000,000</Box>
