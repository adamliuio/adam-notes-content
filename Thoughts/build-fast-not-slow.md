***Patience*** is a misunderstood word. In my opinion, it has been associated with mediocrity, or at least has been used as an excuse for mediocrity.

Because people are patient, the business they want to start should wait, the book they want to read can wait, the gym can wait, the trip can wait. Because they are patient, they can always spend time with their kids when they retire...

But for whatever reason they never let beer, Friday night parties, and basketball games wait.

We're often told that things take time, but it doesn't mean that you should wait around and do nothing. But rather, you should start doing the things you wanna do immediately, or if it's a dream or goal, starting working towards it, and let it work out through time.

**When you have an idea for something, a toy, a product, a business, build it, and put it out there, and let it do its thing. Depending on how much time it requires, attend it regularly, and wait for the results to come patiently.**
