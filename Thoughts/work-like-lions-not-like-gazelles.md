title: "Work Like Lions, Not Like Gazelles"
---

This idea is closely related to [[Think Like Predators]], and it's the opposite to the widely accepted social norm: [[We Are Working Way Too Much]].

The money we earn, and the quality of our lives is not defined by the intensity and the hours we work, but rather, ***it's defined by the value we provide***.

And ***<Highlight>Value increases & decreases in an exponential manner, not in a linear manner.</Highlight>***

If you can provide great value, you should still be rewarded handsomely even if you don't work for a second.

### The Lion's Way

Lions living in the wild Africa are the perfect example of this theory. For most of their lives, they are resting & playing around, the amount of time they spend on hunting is tiny. However, they dominate the top of the food chain.

We should strive to be the same. We should spend most of our time on following our curiosity, trying new things, diving into the fields that interest us, let it be business, sports, coding, music, cooking, or understanding how the world works, etc. This should not be unpleasant, it should not give you the feelings a job gives you.

When you find something that you are good at or passionate about, or you discover an opportunity, and when you decide to do something about it, you should whatever you can, as fast as you can ([[Build Fast, Not Slow]]) to make it happen.

The rewards of working like this will be huge, and your time will be freed. You can use it to do whatever you want: jump onto the next project, retire, spend it with your loved ones... Anything.

But remember:

> ***<Highlight>Lions hunt fast, or they don't catch the preys.</Highlight>***

### The Gazelle's Way

Selling your time for a living by working at a job that you don't like and expecting outstanding rewards is never the way life works. You're working as a machine, you're paid by the hours you work, not rewarded by the value you provide.

In the wealth equation, your playing the plus game (10 + 10 = 20, it's linear), not the multiply game (10 * 10 = 100, it's slightly better), not to even mention the power game (**10 ^ 10 = 10,000,000,000, it's EXPONENTIAL!**).

In this way of working, you're like a gazalle, you're always eating, always chewing to stay alive. You're always preyed upon by the lions, you're always the first one to be sacrificed when harshness comes, and you're always looking out for dangers that's coming your way and ready to run away.

When you're living like a gazalle, a nap is never an option, because it might risk your life.
