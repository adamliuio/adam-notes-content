Wealth is **extremely** important, and not very well understood. In my opinion, **it's something we all should strive for**.

> YOU HAVE TO BE RICH!

To put it simply: **most problems most people have, are *money problems***. [[It sucks to be poor]].

But I truly believe, that **everyone can be rich!**

People understand wealth differently. To some, a person who's making *$100,000 a year (in 2020)* is considered rich, a giant house (without considering the mortgage and the house owner's ability to pay it back) represents *wealth*. But to some, the idea of wealth is drastically different: [[Wealthy People's Definition of Rich]].

But despite of what you think wealth is, at its core:

> Wealth is the ***emotion & attitude*** that helps you navigate through life.

Yes, when asked to describe wealth, the most common answers from people are related to financial and material things, mansions, private jets, luxury watches... But why do they represent wealth? Because they give you the *feeling* of success, achievements, and that you are above other people. And this *feeling* is an ***emotion***, it gives you a different ***attitude*** towards life, no matter this attitude makes you more selfish or more generous.

There's a reason that I said wealth is not very well understood, is because it requires different ways of thinking to acquire true wealth, and these ways of thinking is not adopted by most people living on earth (but maybe it's different on mars?). Here's a list of ways of thinking that building wealth requires but is not intuitive or familiar to most people's understanding: [[The Wealthy Mind]].

In order to have wealth, you need to know [[How To Build Wealth]].
