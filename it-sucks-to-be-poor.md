> It really sucks to be poor.

You see it everywhere. On the street, in the news of 3rd world countries, even in the classrooms. When you don't have money, everything you do and think of is about making the next paycheck, putting the next meal on the table, and maybe winning the lottery so you can have a good life just as the people you envy. There's a study showing that [parents even talk to their kids less when money is tight](https://news.berkeley.edu/2021/07/16/word-gap-when-moneys-tight-parents-talk-less-to-kids/), while all a kid needs is attention & love from parents.

> Money can't buy you happiness, but it can buy you the shit that can make you happy.

I'm not talking about luxuries like Ferraris & Lamborghinis here, that's clich√©. I'm talking about a decent life, and this is more relatable to most people than the fancy cars & houses.

**Money gives your life a chance to be meaningful, instead of being miserable.**

**Being poor in a affluent makes people desperate**. I've had this happened to my relatives and it hurt my own family. If you can't make a living, all the love and care a family's supposed to have is out of the window. Instead, your family members would become your target, because they are the ones you know the best, and they would have their guards down towards you.

Being poor in a 3rd world country would mean your life expectation is much shorter than people in other country, and your life wouldn't be very enjoyable. You're more likely to live in a shack, you might scramble for food, you are very likely to catch deadly diseases, and you would pay much higher prices for the mistakes people in the developed countries made.

Our lives have always been a fight. But no matter what kind of situation you're in, do your best to be rich, at least to be not poor.

And help others if you're not poor.
